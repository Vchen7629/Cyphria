That's say easy, relatively straightforward. worth looking everything honest yet critical eye. Cutting certain budget item, like 'clothing', may seem like reasonable sacrifice moment, end needing later say new, better paying job, could end badly. Changing car ownership transit car sharing; changing two income household childcare costs single income household lower tax bracket; foregoing vacations, dining entirely discretionary spending medical dental expenses - ideas worth exploring.

Spend income zero paper. finally, take budget test drive. may take time, bit trial error, settle budget works well practice theory. Make adjustments. idealistic cuts? finding categories cut further?
