"cursed game design MMOs gather common things people complain mmos paradox. Player: want MMO rewards time gives progression also infinite amount content explore. First sentence hear commonly possible achieve, players want put hours game, get new gear, unlock new content, eventually catch end content. Devs cannot create infinite worlds grind pace players play them. Devs either create daily chores slow progress time-gating make game progression extremely slow takes time grind. Player: want MMO put 12 hours day grinding, hardcore PvP player. Also, want MMO big player base competition game gets excellent care devs. another paradox: every competitive MMO heavily relies gear PvP eventually dies out. reason release, healthiest state, everyone starts clean slate, eventually players hardcore outpace less hardcore casuals, reducing community few. makes devs less profits, take less care game, people quit even snowball effect. Even catch-up mechanics, hardcore players keep outgearing others. Player: want MMO enjoy solo pace force socialize. main problem mentality way work exclusively PvE MMO, alienate pvp competitive players, time, heavily demanding devs constantly create new content, much games like FF WoW done good job side, appeal everyone actually wants socialize mmos. Player: want MMO trading auction house, also want bots, RMT, P2W. another conundrum: long sell things players, real money involved. nature humans pay things cannot have. Player: want MMO army friends fighting masses players like big war. Also, want balanced experience forces almost equal. another big problem ZvZ-type games: rarely feel balanced, time players always band potential winning side. usually ends happening one big group players dominating game gatekeeping everyone else. Player: casual player, Dad, put 2 hours game still would like participate active competitive content. another problem mmos today's landscape. Wow Mmos time released, player base teenagers infinite time throw. many players full-time dads. players feel alienated playing competitive PvP mmos cannot play much hardcore players. Player: want MMO horizontal progression players cannot grind infinitely upwards balanced game. sounds excellent paper, happens generally players' motivation grinding bigger power accumulation involved; remove aspect, less players feel need competitive play, therefore enough motivation play game. Player: want RPG elements open world make players enjoy different types content, like big meteor event changes landscape players interact it. another big problem devs: big events involve lot players. Ideally, want everyone access it, players logged time, alienate players enjoying kind mechanic. much want blame devs making great MMO, one hardest game genres pull off, ROI low amount content need create. companies like NCsoft went full gambling p2w cash grab; make money way. saying impossible make good mmo, many cursed problems dev, question really worth try pull off.

"find GW2 overwhelming new player? start saying enjoy game looking advice. started playing recently since around 2013/14, chars levelled geared help. play style games min-max highest quality optimised gear, float various game modes chase things like achieves. focus far grinding SoTo skyscale, open world / new player experience awful without (especially keeping public events). grinded mounts first make bearable meantime. also dipped every campaign LWS unlock various helpers jade bot, mounts, mastery lines etc. purchased expansions, purchased recommended utility even invested basic things would expect game given, inventory / bag space. issue far overwhelming game feels, despite progression linear gear staying relevant...it feels like bigger grind mmo get wheels running new player. played treadmill mmo's, find gw2 exhausting every way aside gear investment. know tick things slow down, getting point. masteries help massively, ascendance/legendary grind, time gates, story, importance gold/mats need run events / sort farm. there's actual content campaigns, map completion, wvw, spvp, endgame pve - enjoy, want play find consumed everything else. there's catching mastery exp experience similar QOL others. complaints pvp/wvw side things, though there's clearly huge skill disparity spvp old regulars casual. top there's: \- Planning crafting legendary working towards mount skyscale/griffon future? Gold/mats, also unlock XYZ certain timegates daily/weekly get started take years. problem playing campaigns, timegates become daily chores. \- want raid / challenges? Lol KP. 'but go training discord' - yeah wait entire week single wing training run, spend 1-2hrs wiping disband. Plus go full circle got 50kp boss. (My experience week) \- Enjoy decorating building bases? homestead set back thousands gold / gems get nodes decent amount decorations. Speaking gold - ton gold invest various gold making methods TP flips, Anet's solution new feature seems gold/gem sink (ie Wizard's Gobbler) top existing necessities, qol additions wants gold needed for. there's 'luck' stat far understand caps 750% gold magic find, putting new players disadvantage (especially advised get baseline 200+). advice give spend 2hrs+ running certain meta trains day make 100-200g, get's old fast never seems net masses. say thank goodness Wizards tower - welcome feature. know tick things become less overwhelming less grind, therefore enjoyable. looking advice get stage. enjoying game, equally losing interest overwhelming feels.","MMORPG","gaming"
"Gamefest 2025, MMORPG devs actually need differently succeed? watching MMORPG reveals Gamefest 2025, I‚Äôve thinking lot genre headed. saw Cube strange sci-fi twist, Chrono Odyssey showing flashy action combat, Dune: Awakening going survival route, more. It‚Äôs cool seeing many MMOs spotlight again, also feels like we‚Äôre weird ‚Äúmaybe it‚Äôll work, maybe won‚Äôt‚Äù kind moment. games probably pop bit fade out.. we‚Äôve seen happen example ongoing struggle New World, imo weird place Throne Liberty currently ik P2W elements. I‚Äôm wondering: MMO devs actually differently right want make something lasts? Like: - pick niche really go all-in one thing? Like PvP specific stuff experience like Cube? - Prioritize fair monetization start (no P2W, maybe subs cosmetics)? - Start small polished instead big broken? I‚Äôm dev, someone who‚Äôs played ton MMOs years misses feeling getting hooked long haul. Would love hear others, especially seeing Gamefest brought table. building MMO 2025, would differently overcome one another, become irrelevant Christmas?","MMORPG","gaming"
