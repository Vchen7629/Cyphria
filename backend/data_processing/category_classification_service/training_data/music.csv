"What techno/electronic/whatever songs mess with your brain? (in a good way) So, what songs mess with your ears / brain, but not necessarily in a harsh way... things like Left / Right or spatial awareness, knows when to hit highs and low, and uses the available sound space in either very cool or unique ways... music that you MUST use headphones for, you know? Ya, you know...Music can feel beyond multi-dimensional to me, so some you must feel the same. I know there has to be a ton out there, but I just don't know where to find it or what to call it. I haven't listened to techno or electronic music in FOREVER so the ONLY example I can even give is ""Powerglove - Streets of 2043"" It has lots of L/R play, layering stuff in the right place at the right time, different use of filters,... the bass could hit a little harder, but it's good enough lol... this song is an absolutely journey and it feels as though it's traveling through my ears, into my brain, and passing through in the most unique way possible.

Slaytan / Dead Rising Volbeat. Apparently, first time saw live first show skipped Dead Rising since released eight years earlier. rest shows year featured it, quite shows next year setlist well. year that, played all, year saw second time. year that, played two shows played song one them. saw year, played year, three times seeing them, somehow always missed song. 2. War Alter Bridge. rotation songs then-new album *Pawns & Kings*, show get it, rather got different song. 3. Strange Girl Halestorm. favorite song still seen live. apparently played lot 2022, year release, one two songs album never played year. discovered late 2022, already stopped playing it. pestered Lzzy boys every time see (I seen four times) play it, luck. Lzzy even responded first time said would try remember show, happen. 4. Found Way Plush. first time saw them, really expecting play since opening band, second time, headliner, hoped would play it. not; make setlist tour. made setlist next tour, though, missed show near vacation. 5. Talk & Walk Mammoth. saw first show tour supporting *Mammoth II*, idea expect setlist. tour featured song, first time played long time, guessed would keep it. not. 6. Bell Tolls Master Puppets Metallica. Believe not, play songs one time saw them. first time ever Repeat thing two nights, one thought would actually it. saw second show, played entire *Black Album* songs. Therefore, missed lot hits played first show, including two songs. 7. Last Man Standing Pop Evil. used every setlist 2021, saw year first, far only, time. played two three times since then. Funny enough, guitar tech soundchecking guitar, played riff song, made sad knew band going play it. 8. Nice Day Bon Jovi. first English-language rock concert, remember screaming song 200-level seats hoping band would somehow hear me. young fun. Anyway, played song shows tour, guess got unlucky. Something years later kind made it; saw Bon Jovi tribute band, played song. Glad: 1. Tread Volbeat. first time saw 2021, year released Metallica cover *Metallica Blacklist*, played every show year. saw second show 2021. since become third-favorite Volbeat song. stopped playing completely year over. 2. Burn Down, Stay, Pawns & Kings Alter Bridge. remains seen whether songs continue played Alter Bridge tours again, last two, likely played tend keep songs albums past fourth one around respective tours over. makes especially glad saw particular tour, Pawns & Kings third-favorite song them. Stay also played much even tour. Burn Down, played one lot anyone expected, basically replaced Mark vocal songs. assume go back instead next tour, could wrong. 3. Given Linkin Park. mean, stopped playing song live, rotation (they setlists called A, B, C rotate order), guess got lucky show one song setlist. 4. Right? Mammoth. Even better, live debut song. already second-favorite Mammoth song that. seem playing much anymore, new album coming, probably return, least while. 5. Tread Metallica. much fan version song (I like Volbeat version better Metallica song, fact), still glad got see it, never play live outside *Black Album* playthroughs. 6. Sticks & Bricks Day Remember. Apparently, first time saw them, setlist tour really crazy featured lot rare songs. favorite those. 7. Tourniquet Breaking Benjamin. second-favorite Breaking Benjamin song. ever played 2019 2022, dropped setlist midway tour saw 2022. lucky see earlier tour. 8.
