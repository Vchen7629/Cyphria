Also, keep mind lion's teeth better designed combat bear's, meaning lion takes clear edge field. seem information arm strength American lion, given grizzly bear longer claws weight, safe say bear much deadlier paw. Surprisingly, bear reach speed 30-40 mph, lion reach 30mph. Granted, movement speed important fight; attack speed agility matter. Given lion cat, pretty obvious cat takes edge agility arguably combat speed. American lion's diet mostly consisted large animals like bison, deer, even mammoths, bear's diet mostly fish berries. Additionally, American lions coexisted interacted short-faced bear, grizzly bear never seen anything remotely like lion, besides cougar, around 5 times lighter. American lion similar social structure African lion which bit stretch, lion probably lots experience combat. safe say lion better experience/battle experience. Anyway, lion advantage combat speed, agility, bite effectiveness, experience/battle experience. Meanwhile, bear takes size, weight, arm strength, durability, Intelligence Given info, think would win fight, assuming bloodlusted, either equally capable scaring off.

"Thoughts Mobile Suit Gundam 00 seasons movie Awakening Trailblazer. one pretty good. think anywhere close best installment franchise far, nowhere close worst either, opinion. perfectly middle road compared Gundam installments seen far, that's meant insult. Considering worst series consists near trash like Superior Defender Gundam Force, best original Mobile Suit Gundam debatably first season Mobile Suit Gundam Seed, installments, especially ones go long, straight terrible, series middle road still makes pretty entertaining. series takes place yet another new timeline, called Anno Domini timeline, AD timeline. guessed it, seasons plus movie series anime take place timeline, although light novels manga expand timeline. anyways, like usual, technical stuff improved here, especially animation, art, fight scenes. That's especially case movie. makes sense though movie, mention one came 2010, 15 years ago. getting recent Gundam now, relatively speaking anyways. even two seasons anime somewhat recent comparison older installments, aired 2007-2009. Like best Gundam series, anime themes includes war, also minor themes like love friendship, intertwined anti war themes. times execution themes could get slightly cheesy, enough completely ruin series me. first half show bit slow, although never boring. second half show got super engrossing, towards end show even tragic, lot people would probably expect Gundam anime. think movie unnecessary, still bad.","Gundam","anime"

"120 days passed, I’ve finally finished first sketchbook, it’s probably valuable possession. Flipping pages like roller coaster emotions own. 120 days drawing everyday almost. first plan share reaching 1 year mark, kinda changed mind realized finally finished first ever sketchbook, sketchbook bought 4 years ago draw quarantine boredom, never did, now. I‘ll share day 61\~120, want keep short don’t want repeat day 30 60 post, probably improve much, ehh. texts ahead quite cheesy personal, I’m sorry advance. reason picked pencil chain events kickstarted art journey. chain jealousy, fear, passion, inspiration, real life experiences, bottled frustration, pushed pick pencil seriously first time. art journey less getting good drawing, fighting fears self improvement. last 120 days, went kind emotions: 1. Fear changes: Tbh, I‘m lazy person, often put bare minimum effort things barely interest in. attending certain class university seeing Pewdiepie’s progress, realized want pull current mediocre life need overhaul mentality work hard. went believing “oh talent.”, “If too!“. started researching get good art, observing people learn art. laid study plan, planning without actions fancy talking, picked pencil first 4 10 years so. 2. Fear consistent: Since wanted improve fats, picked hard method draw everyday. spent half much time fighting much draw, kept feeling afraid “what make it?” “What art me?”. almost gave barely made past first week. decided, really want get good fast learn smart. rewatch other‘s progress, pointing inefficiencies, developed personalized study plan prioritize efficiencyI explain later. improvements started popping day day, fear ”art me” gone, worry consistent. since drawing much fun reminded much used love drawing little, consistent became less challenge like hobby. 3. Fear trusting myself: months even now, I’m still fully trusting draw. happens, normally flip sketchbook, eases nervousness bit, since it’s literally statement somewhat draw. that’s pretty much it, art journey proving it, also escape mind soul. know it’s cheesy, sorry again. . . . Ok, I’ll share full detail study plan, since many asked last two posts, couldn’t give proper answer time, since still refining study plan time. whole study plan prioritizing efficiency optimization, basically constant loop feedbacks adjustments: Draw > Reflect > Take Note > Adjust > Repeat. Pretty much must practices actually help learn. also make mistake, leave is, take note move on, look back actually something remind mistake. make study plan works goal first, current goal characters drawing, main focus anatomy. mainly anatomy study now, don’t want overload information. first didn’t know practice, decided “if wanted learn something, might well learn pros.”, bought books anatomy. one good think book course, it‘s like teacher telling whenever you’re sure do, it’s like everyone exactly next time right? whenever don’t know practice, pretty much everyday :p, open book tells exactly next. Also start, study plan kinda go fast cut corner, realized hurt long run. went cherry picking example draw book, draw almost everything, gave fast part enjoy process. However, study plan / feedback loop, kinda like echo chamber, that’s occasionally try get external feedback pros, like making posts like this. I’m sorry sounds cunning like I’m trying use people personal gain. last least, Balance. Grinding away fundamentals studies get boring pretty quick, whenever I‘m mood lazy, still try show draw something fun like anime stuffs, doesn’t always serious grind, it’s showing consistent. whenever finish study day, there’s time blank space paper left, fill something fun. one probably quite controversial art community, find ChatGPT useful hobby virtual assistant. However don’t use generate image, chatbot get information, feedback, brainstorming. That’s pretty much everything study plan, probably won’t line post, it’s adaptable. . . .

"Should I do a DBA or keep growing under current name? When I first labeled my business it, was sales centered but eventually I got referrals into other industries.  The word ""sales"" is in my business LLC name but in Spanish.  Now it doesn't make much sense when targeting clients that does not need ""sales"" teams just assistants.  (I am in the BPO industry).  They just want assistants and my MX corporation to deal with all the legal benefits and HR part.   I would like to make a dba and create a more generic name.  For example instead of ""sales outsourcing"" maybe ""VirtualPro"" (for the record i am NOT using this or even thinking about this name, i am just using it as an example"" - .   Our main way of getting clients is personal connections and referals for most part.  So question is- is it worth getting dba if obtaining new clients is via personal reference and get dba later when we do more Automated marketing?","business","business"

First all, I’m Ukraine I’ve experienced war firsthand. past three years I’ve adapt new conditions learned lessons stay life. valuable lesson I’ve learned: life precious, often shorter imagine. guarantees you’ll time world. That’s it’s worth thinking pursue dreams now, someday future. course, depends resources situation. first business hardware startup. team school friends came together create device would help people control climate room improve well-being. Two years mistakes poor decisions eventually led team falling apart startup shutting down. experience business development, market research, things disorganized. despite everything, managed create working version product, national competition, made couple dozen sales. Here’s another key piece advice: understand product service. market research, interview potential users, build minimum viable product, try clearly define value. can’t explain business matters one sentence, you’re probably right track. idea solve real problem. least create compelling one solve (haha). second business video game development studio. working hardware project, also got game development. started learning programming making games. total crap, loved process. shutting first startup, got idea start making commercial mobile games. shared idea friend, 3D artist, began new journey. hard, exciting. Within first six months, released game started earning $1K per month without spending anything ads. us, incredible, thrilled. kept working game war began, eventually sell project put everything hold. didn’t give up. adapted new reality kept building project project. nothing worked. two years, made games saw profit all. end, decided shut everything down. burned frustrated mobile market. Despite efforts – asking advice, talking players, hours brainstorming – couldn’t find niche. felt like gambling business creative field. Lesson learned: don’t see clear path profit, need rethink business. shouldn’t expect make good money first 6 12 months, especially without major investments. you’ve working year two zero results, it’s worth asking whether business worth continuing. didn’t give games entirely. Instead, completely changed strategy. moved console platforms began offering porting publishing services. Platforms like Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox high entry threshold, many developers find expensive time-consuming release games there. solve problem exchange percentage sales. start 2024, switched new model, December already reached break-even. five full-time employees, six months, we’re slowly steadily becoming profitable. won’t lie – difficult path. still days think quitting starting something completely different. Game development isn’t highest-paying industry tech, it’s also bad people think. don’t plan stop business. Sooner later, I’ll probably leave start something new. would really appreciate advice thoughts, I’m happy answer questions. Thanks lot reading story!","Entrepreneur","business"

"""Mossad Principle"" VC & Startups: Best Deals Happen Shadows best venture funds act like intelligence agencies public companies. quiet, efficient invisible. Think Mossad: flashy sign busy street, public ""We’re hiring agents!"" announcements, conferences work.

I’ve tested AI bots constantly scan startup ecosystem, surfacing promising teams way anyone’s talking them. AI agents do: \- Scrape traffic-growth metrics (think SimilarWeb) \- Analyze public signals LLM + custom data pipelines \- Vet product-market fit early usage dataTrack hiring patterns & team growth \- Estimate deal potential fair valuations automatically principle works founders. experience, investable startups aren’t pitching big stages working conference circuit. They’re weeds, shipping quietly, barely visible, totally focused building. time hear them, it’s already late invest reasonable valuation. Takeaways: you’re fund: skip hype, build ""intel.""

"Study advices TL;DR: I want to get a scholarship, but I need to get a high GPA. What should I do? I’m a student who doesn’t like studying (I don’t think many people actually like studying, except for a few). I study just to get good grades, and then I forget everything after the exams. I’m not really interested in understanding—I just memorize and write down what I remember in the test, even if I don’t understand a single word. I only study during exam time, and thank God I manage to get decent grades. I need to raise my GPA by 0.6% to get the scholarship. That sounds like a small number, right? But the problem is, I’m kind of late. If I had pushed myself a bit in the first semester, I might’ve reached my goal (kind of—though I don’t think I could’ve maintained that GPA). But unfortunately, I slacked off. Now I have two semesters left. I need to get around 98.5% in the next semester to reach my goal, and that’s a really high target for me, since I’ve never gotten that before. My GPA usually ranges between 90% and 95%. Or, I could get around 96.3% across both remaining semesters. But honestly, I don’t think I can hit that target. I want to give it my all from the start of the year. and even if i get it i don’t think so i can maintain that GPA.I want to review daily. I don’t want to regret it after graduating. If you have any advice or suggestions—anything you think might help me—I really need it. I have so much more to say, but this is already getting too long. Thanks. ","studytips","education"

"cursed game design MMOs gather common things people complain mmos paradox. Player: want MMO rewards time gives progression also infinite amount content explore. First sentence hear commonly possible achieve, players want put hours game, get new gear, unlock new content, eventually catch end content. Devs cannot create infinite worlds grind pace players play them. Devs either create daily chores slow progress time-gating make game progression extremely slow takes time grind. Player: want MMO put 12 hours day grinding, hardcore PvP player. Also, want MMO big player base competition game gets excellent care devs. another paradox: every competitive MMO heavily relies gear PvP eventually dies out. reason release, healthiest state, everyone starts clean slate, eventually players hardcore outpace less hardcore casuals, reducing community few. makes devs less profits, take less care game, people quit even snowball effect. Even catch-up mechanics, hardcore players keep outgearing others. Player: want MMO enjoy solo pace force socialize. main problem mentality way work exclusively PvE MMO, alienate pvp competitive players, time, heavily demanding devs constantly create new content, much games like FF WoW done good job side, appeal everyone actually wants socialize mmos. Player: want MMO trading auction house, also want bots, RMT, P2W. another conundrum: long sell things players, real money involved. nature humans pay things cannot have. Player: want MMO army friends fighting masses players like big war. Also, want balanced experience forces almost equal. another big problem ZvZ-type games: rarely feel balanced, time players always band potential winning side. usually ends happening one big group players dominating game gatekeeping everyone else. Player: casual player, Dad, put 2 hours game still would like participate active competitive content. another problem mmos today's landscape. Wow Mmos time released, player base teenagers infinite time throw. many players full-time dads. players feel alienated playing competitive PvP mmos cannot play much hardcore players. Player: want MMO horizontal progression players cannot grind infinitely upwards balanced game. sounds excellent paper, happens generally players' motivation grinding bigger power accumulation involved; remove aspect, less players feel need competitive play, therefore enough motivation play game. Player: want RPG elements open world make players enjoy different types content, like big meteor event changes landscape players interact it. another big problem devs: big events involve lot players. Ideally, want everyone access it, players logged time, alienate players enjoying kind mechanic. much want blame devs making great MMO, one hardest game genres pull off, ROI low amount content need create. companies like NCsoft went full gambling p2w cash grab; make money way. saying impossible make good mmo, many cursed problems dev, question really worth try pull off.

I also have had shortness of breath for the last several months. No real medical background to explain any of this other than LIGHT asthma due to particular pet allergies and sadly, alcohol overuse 😕 I went to the local urgent care center, which had neither urgency nor care, and then my PCP who blamed everything on asthma and seasonal allergies, the latter of which I do not have at all *definitively*. I didn’t need my regular asthma medication for over a year because I no longer had certain pets that caused my allergy-related asthma.

Symptoms super severe, least certainly compared now. could definitely go lot detail, already written entire post got deleted accident cant write lol. get basics— long time pretty moderate controlable symptoms, pretty much textbook moderate pots nothing bad, nothing great either. symptoms got severe past eight nine months, actually passing lot frequently used smaller smaller things triggering responses. kind expected condition progress alarming, especially fact happened gradually really struggling since beginning year past month experiencing symptoms much intense used to, much frequent, can't think way considered normal anymore. one, resting heart rate currently sits around 45 going different factors super shocking, spikes daily 230 BPM. Definitely normal! triggered almost anything, sometimes happens completely own. Accompanied typical symptoms listed much severe weakness, near collapse chest tightness head rush, tinnitus strong wave fatigue much frequently passing out. can't truly describe feeling chest happens almost like somebody's grabbing heart balling fist, something similar need vomit, coming chest. Instead stomach, like somethings trying get out. Obviously that's implying that's description give makes sort sense weird fuck. something experienced maybe five times life recall outside past eight nine months. times called mini heart attack lol. laughed went infrequent. happens every single day, often multiple times day. also probably add prior last months tachycardia usually lasted 30 45 seconds goes anywhere one five minutes . absolutely exhausting entire body fallen asleep places think could fall asleep takes energy happens . said, happen smallest things entirely nowhere..multiple times absolutely nothing happens terrifying. also happens frequently cough, yawn, etc. Even though naturally jumpy person, slight startle dog barking loud noise enough send episodes, pretty much every day. Additionally, strong emotional responses.. shocked reading something stupid news something like boom. Congrats floor heart rate 230 clutching nearest stable surface. fun! incredibly abnormal me, can't identify possible cause could've made things get much worse quick. multiple echocardiograms done heart physically appeared normal.

That's good apparent structural problems, kind take serious anymore starting become problem. never really scared symptoms know live every day killed yet, going to, genuinely starting scare me. messaged cardiologist response got anything concern... kind seemed irritated me. exact response ""The increase heart rate normal response stress, surprise, activity. keeping fluids difficult lately, could consider IV fluids management POTS. manageable removing stimulus sitting down, concerned heart rate spike."" oh, OK.

Definitely really condescending though. asked wanted heart rate monitor, year obviously do, ordered, received yet. honestly, main reason bothered fact done minimal research anything surrounding heart really idea what's going on, know EKG echocardiogram there's blatantly obvious physical problem heart known long time. similar testing that's done tilt table, tests done year ago, obviously fine, want seem even consider possibility something else might wrong. Maybe paranoid, feel right can't shake feeling, really scary. even seen appointment since early February, messages communicated text even directly doctor. seem worried whatsoever every response gotten undertone sounds like really believe me. Maybe that's reflection treated doctors, really shitty experiences G.I. issues taken seriously, either way feel great scared nobody wants hear me. feel also probably add that. see way could due deconditioning anything like that. active physically be. someone really hard time accepting need take break overdo chance get, probably good thing better anything guess. elliptical use one two hours every day, pretty pretty much unless physically can't it. manage condition, tried medication. bad reactions them.. expected, pharmacogenetics testing done adds this. consume much liquid/water stomach capacity, still enough majority consume liquid form, take electrolytes every day. done everything advised cardiologist, literally idea happening. entirely sure point even really posting , sure probably forgetting something, quite tired moment, need get there. input advice, etc. would greatly appreciated, really would like get opinions something really right worried really normal could considered normal even though never happened before. really know feel know serious making really is. apologize hard read, honestly main question is; really ever considered normal heart rate spike 45 bpm 230 bpm slight postural changes, getting mildly startled, yawning, coughing nothing all??","AskDocs","health"

Thing is, contact lenses combine two things really expensive here, can't afford them. also glasses, corrections astigmatism nearsightedness, place made great job, can't see best them.

"roman Titanomachy never knew topic ""romans bad, changed greek myth"" always stupid thing like Medusa Arachne something sort, point discussion. one look closely, actually things find roman mythology, greek, ones discussed more. Ouranos castration Titanomachy. Ouranos castration never mentioned Ovid Hyginus tellings origin world. Ovid mentions world created ""god"" put gods place. skips Saturn cast Tartarus Jupiter. Hyginus mention gods reproducing goes straight Jupiter rule. roman author mention Cicero, says ""according greeks... Saturn castrated Caelum"". romans apperantly never even concept Saturn attacking Caelum. make sense, since Kronos Saturn different deities, Saturn way benevolent Kronos was, altrough Kronos, like gods, neither good evil worshipped places god ""slaves"" since golden age, society, state families, thus, neither slaves opressors festival Kronia. Titanomachy also widely different. Except retelling orphic myth Zagreus Hyginus ""150"", romans basically lumped together Jupiter enemies one single battle: titan gods, giants, Typhon. fighting one battle. Hecatoncheries, rarely Zeus greek myth, always enemies roman myth. Virgil places Briareus prisoner Tartarus, alongside monsters. Ovid Horace mentions Giges Jupiter enemy, Ovid goes even says Giges attempted ""kidnap"" Ceres/Demeter battle and Ovid uses Demeter argument, since knows almost kidnapped male figure, like daughter. Virgil Georgics mentions Tellus/Gaia gave birth ""Coeus, Iapetus Typhon"" fight Jupiter. basically, titan gods, giants, Typhon, mashed together. believe confusion giants titans began, outside context titans olympians exactly same, giants half human/half god/half snake beings, sometimes winged gigantic features. romans apperantly, often placed Iapetus Astreus giants example. Ovid also mentions Atlas ""gigantic size"". greeks different views beings roles, place different points ""timeline"". romans believed Saturn agricultural deity that Kronos never way later merged Saturn, thus, way connected mother Tellus. greece, Gaia allied Zeus Kronos. Rome however, Tellus usually Saturn side, thus, Jupiter comes face Saturn, Tellus produces giants monsters fight Saturn side. Also, Kronos brothers sisters usually group greek myth, titan gods, Saturn others roman myth. Saturn always seen Tellus special child, never said giant monster, Coeus Iapetus, brothers greek mythology, always downgraded either giants something sort roman myths. Basically, romans lumped titans, giants Typhon together mentioned, Saturn still different them. Saturn represented Tellus/Gaia good side, agricultural bounty. children... bad side.","GreekMythology","history"

"finished Clifton Chronicles — thoughts. feel same? recently wrapped Clifton Chronicles genuinely enjoyed overall journey, see clarity — especially reflecting seven books. first three books absolutely excellent. character arcs Harry, Emma, Giles felt natural, emotionally rich, truly character-driven. struggles, ambition, class divides made compelling storytelling. book four onward, felt series gradually became plot-stretched. business angles Sebastian’s early arc Samantha still good, many storylines started feeling manufactured. example, Samantha’s sudden exit felt unjustified forced. point, Harry central character faded, focus shifting Giles, Emma, especially Sebastian. time reached books six seven, quality dropped me. Priya arc book six beautifully built — abruptly ended without proper emotional follow-up. genuinely frustrated me. last book, overwhelmed much space given Virginia Fenwick — point overshadowed core cast. arc, especially ending, didn’t feel earned. Also, heavy exposition later books took away earlier charm Archer’s smoother storytelling. still read emotional attachment need closure — hindsight, final three books didn’t feel rewarding. Still, don’t regret reading them. Archer’s style, especially early on, readable compelling keep going. understand many Reddit mixed series.

"Similarities Bolano's 2666 Borge's ""An examination work Herbert Quain"" reading Ficciones reminded Bolano's 2666. curious anyone else noticed this. “An examination work Herbert Quain” Borges describes detective novel final paragraph line ""“Everyone thought encounter two chess players accidental” makes reader realise detective hasn’t solved murder correctly. Upon re-reading final chapters reader realises murderer someone else detective missed. disquieting twist typical detective novel. Instead book finishing case solved justice served, reader left realisation killer go unpunished. What’s worse, detective main protagonist story busy congratulating case well solved, completely unaware murderer still large. many ways 2666 resembles detective novel. murders, detectives, clues seem hint solution eventually revealed. Like Borges’ proposed novel, killer killers never bought justice, unlike Borges’ novel reader can’t work either. also moments novel Bolano gives reader information unavailable characters oddly reminiscent Borges’ imagined detective novel. one passage, Bolano describes encounter three friends: *""Norton made frequent rather tasteless references ex-husband lurking threat, ascribed vices defects monster, horribly violent monster one never materialized, monster evocation action, although words Norton managed give substance neither Espinoza Pelletier ever seen, ex existed dreams, Pelletier, sharper Espinoza, understood Norton’s unthinking diatribe, endless list grievances, anything punishment inflicted herself, perhaps shame fallen love cretin married him. Pelletier, course, wrong.""* paragraph like mini version detective novel Borges describes. mystery (Why Norton acting way?), solution offered seemingly “sharp” protagonist (She punishing herself), final line pulls rug us (Pelletier’s solution wrong). though, difference Borges’ detective novel re-read paragraph solution presents itself. *had* Norton kept talking boyfriend. Pelletier sharp unable solve mystery, hope reader have? Sometimes life feel like detective novel.

I’m Greece. here, local book culture is….a bit underdeveloped, let’s say. due many factors: first all, literature isn’t really taught expansively school, does, it’s done somewhat rough way, let’s say, many people grow reading appreciating written word all. Secondly, Greek publishing industry extremely monopolized, controlled cartel handful large publishers. make difficult author publish book become successful recognized. Many smaller publishers exist course, don’t expect exactly make headlines going them. also culture extreme overwork, leaving little real free time people, time spend things reading. Saying that, remains, I’d say popular book genres crime fiction, romance, historical fiction, children’s fiction (which use umbrella term book marketed towards adults specifically), lot times, combination above. various authors become locally famous writing genres, wont mention simply believe they’d pretty unknown outside Greece. genres like science fiction, fantasy horror particularly popular well known public (although internationally popular works like Harry Potter LOTR certainly lot fans).

Ya, you know...Music can feel beyond multi-dimensional to me, so some you must feel the same. I know there has to be a ton out there, but I just don't know where to find it or what to call it. I haven't listened to techno or electronic music in FOREVER so the ONLY example I can even give is ""Powerglove - Streets of 2043"" It has lots of L/R play, layering stuff in the right place at the right time, different use of filters,... the bass could hit a little harder, but it's good enough lol... this song is an absolutely journey and it feels as though it's traveling through my ears, into my brain, and passing through in the most unique way possible.

"found perfect tripod yet? build own! Or: fell love Novoflex Allow tell experience tripods far: **Humble beginnings: Manfrotto 190XPROB 496RC2 ball head** started wildlife photography journey four years ago, purchased Canon 90D Tamron 150-600 G2. dabbled photography before, using Canon 60D, kit zoom plastic-fantastic, nifty fifty, four years ago time get bit serious concerning gear. key piece almost every photographers kit tripod. started old trusty Manfrotto 190XPROB 496RC2 ball head, tripod likely known many, similar popular Manfrotto 055XPROB. job held camera pretty securely, trips bicycle foot realised wanted something lighter, probably without center column. also happy Manfrotto plates wanted try Arca Swiss system. **Cheap wobbly: Rollei CT-5C** got Rollei CT-5C (around € 100 time), cheap, light, carbon tripod neat little feature: legs could swapped little ones achieve super low working height. However, simply weak hold Canon 90D Tamron 150-600 G2 securely. No, mean ballhead came included, okay job. mean tripod: could see wear tear, metal parts spider used hold legs certain angle even one two trips outside. simply fit purpose, intended far lighter setups. quickly sold using trusty old Manfrotto again. also wanted try different heads ballhead interested gimbals fluid heads. **Affordable, big beefy: Innorel RT90C Manfrotto MVH502AH** meant get another tripod, sturdy one time: looked online stumbled across Innorel RT90C. affordable (about € 300 time), incredibly sturdy, large heavy tripod. 40mm top section diameter, center column, bowl leveling base. Somewhat low working height. set. ballhead got okay, quickly swapped Manfrotto MVH502AH fluid head (which use Arca Swiss system, fixed attaching cheap clamp onto plate). meant tripod setup, including head, 75 cm long weighed 4kg. that's heavy simply unwiedly setup transporting bicycle foot. Attaching small LowePro sling bag time really option, time held left hand steering right. proper solution, dangerous times, wanted stability (and still does) well. still beefy tripod. **Big backpack, much stuff** Looking safer solution transport it, got bigger backpack (Tasmanian Tiger Modular Pack 45+). busy trying different pouches attachments due MOLLE/PALS webbing eventually found configuration (Tac Pouch 9 SP either side Extendable Bladder Pouch front carry tripod) allowed somewhat comfortably carry camera, lenses, tripod, food, water, extra jackets, massive first aid kit, huge camouflage net, ground sheet, sitting pads, even hunting sitting bag (similar sleeping bag) cold weather. big tripod led get big backpack, much room. Room filled mostly unnecessary things. setting camp edge fields easily noticeable animals. backpack, including tripod 20kg made comfortable. carrying way much stuff wanted something smaller. **Finding happy modular medium: Novoflex Triopod (C2840) Classic Ball 5 II** decided get smaller backpack (Tasmanian Tiger Modular Combat Pack, 22l) take really needed. Camera, lens, batteries, SD cards, folding thin sleeping pad, binoculars, water bottle, camouflage packs small (Ghosthood makes amazing stuff) and... large heavy tripod. tripod attached side backpack, shifted whole weight distribution immensely, wanted something smaller again. Still stable, beefy anymore. stumbled across company Novoflex decided get Triopod C2840 legs. tripod legs? Yes. tripod consists legs spider, joining legs allowing head attached. Usually, spider legs separated, sometimes one leg taken use monopod. However Novoflex uses completely modular system, meaning offer (amongst things) tripod spiders legs different sizes. joined together, meaning small spider beefy, long legs, rather large spider thinner, shorter legs case medium sized spider medium sized legs. meant could simply carry legs spider attached head separately bag, resulting amazingly easy pack tripod. outside could simply quickly screw legs spider good go. impressed manufacturing quality, also decided get head Novoflex, Classic Ball 5 II Q-Base II. large ball head incredibly easy reliable friction adjustment quick release Arca Swiss clamp. (and still am) happy purchase carried photography, simply worrying tripod. be. **Getting low importance levelling** two year ago, upgraded camera, finally arriving mirrorless age Canon R6 II. Still using Tamron 150-600 G2, noticed AF working should, eventually decided upgrade lens Canon 500mm F4 II. big jump, noticed wildlife photography favourite hobby still taking seriously. lots fun see animals going day. Eventually, noticed lot photos, needed work low ground, least sitting ground, really lie down. Many times thought getting smaller legs (C2820) Novoflex, could get low enough choosing specific spots adjusting legs time. Getting whole setup levelled however easy, meaning almost exclusively stuck CB 5 II use Manfrotto fluid head, would better head time. Using ball head big lens means either lock unlock whole time (which easy CB 5 II, still annoying) friction dialled perfectly (which easy CB 5 II) prevent setup flopping down, potentially damaging camera and/or lens. friction dialled means move setup time, constantly work friction, puts stress bayonett joining lens camera. feel great do. Eventually, decided purchase Novoflex even happier. even experience, decided get even smaller backpack (Tasmanian Tiger Essential Bag L) would still allow carry needed. stuff easily packable wanted venture deeper woods lighter pack. sometimes even leaving pack behind entirely somewhat safe spot walk woods hip bag (Decathlon Solognac X-Access Hip Bag, 7l). **Finally inner peace: Triopod Pro75, C3940, C2820, Magic Balance, TrioBalance Wimberley WH-200 II** May 2025, decided time. researched Novoflex homepage days, determined find perfect combination amongst spiders, legs accessories make. ended largest spider (Triopod Pro75), allows easily fit levelling base (Magic Balance) bowl adapter like Innorel RT90C. convenient stable. Concerning legs ended big legs (C3940) case ever need (also planning use monopod) small two-section legs (C2820) eyeing year now. ones using most, perfect working low ground, either sitting ditch lying down. levelling easy, wanted upgrade fluid head well simply better solution compared ball head. However, fluid heads tipping point center gravity lens, meaning whole setup tip towards front back eventually, least affordable fluid heads large heavy lenses. decided get gimbal head. taking chances, splurged done got Wimberley WH-200 II. Novoflex one point make gimbal head, although double gimbal head called Falcon, simply more, heavier larger need. still pity Novoflex make regular gimbal head though, would absolutely gotten that. ""hip bag trips"" still want tripod sometimes, least small one, backup tripod case decide stay one spot lie down. case, got TrioBalance Mini another Q-Base II. small spider integrated levelling base comes cute little, nevertheless strong sturdy, mini legs. Q-Base II attached directly spider, allowing camera lens tilted 20° enough time, head needed. mini setup easily fits hip bag, weighs less kg comfortably securely holds heavy big prime camera grip. finally found perfect tripod - well perfect parts build tripod could need given situation. confident products easily last next 10-20 years, quite possibly even longer. incredibly high quality. Oh case something goes wrong - post service issues deliver parcel - customer support quick respond, competent friendly. E-mails usually answered withing hours (during week) experience. something ever go wrong, hesitate one bit ask help confident solving problem quickly efficiently. **Conclusion** one tripod hardly ever enough, many need want large sturdy one small light one. going next logical step: tripods entirely modular. Want legs smaller larger without changing anything spider? Want big sturdy spider need long legs, working low ground anyways? Want unscrew legs spider make tripod easier transport? it. Novoflex. know manufacturer offering absolute modularity. look products. made Germany company great interact with. happier.

"Smartphone Photography Raised Bar Photographers past decade, I’ve noticed subtle significant shift photography one that’s easy overlook it’s happened gradually: smartphones quietly raised bar consider “good” photo. Ten years ago, decent DSLR mirrorless camera, light-years ahead people. Camera phones still catching struggled low light, limited dynamic range, often lacked clarity depth came proper lens sensor. Simply owning good camera gave advantage. didn’t even need try hard clean, well-lit shot nice bokeh practically screamed quality. Now? gap closed… dramatically. Modern phones like iPhone, Pixel, Samsung Galaxy pushing computational photography wild levels. balance exposure automatically, fake background blur decently well, pull dynamic range would taken post processing achieve long ago. Casual users regularly producing clean, punchy, “professional-looking” shots pointing shooting. that’s kind incredible, also challenge. someone using dedicated camera, I’ve realized bar raised. used make work stand (sharpness, clean exposure, nice color) minimum. photo doesn’t offer something storytelling, mood, emotion, unique composition it’ll probably blend noise. It’s longer enough good gear; photo matters what. Don’t get wrong.. love photography accessible now. think it’s made craft demanding way. stand out, you’ve got intentional. Thoughtful.

I’m shy romantic, sensitive, affectionate, I’ve always deep desire connection. go lot — bars, concerts — I’m terrible approaching people real life. rarely find people I’m attracted to. Dating apps felt like option, even though they’ve mostly led disappointment. feels like people like never want me, ones want people I’m attracted nothing common with. past years, I’ve maybe ten “starts” something, three could called actual relationships. them, never truly loved back. I’m always one lowering standards, giving more, told I’m “too good,” “too much,” “give much.” try stay true — it’s exhausting one seems want that. last two relationships left sad. first long-distance relationship American guy. got close loved band. came live France three months, went Montana... felt real. end, told wasn’t love left. second even harder. situationship someone considered best friend. manipulated months, emotionally toyed me, end wanted sleep me. even cheated front me. completely shattered trust. Since then, I’ve dating apps, trying stay open. recent experience wasn’t even relationship — conversation — it’s one made crack. matched online talked hours. attractive, artistic, emotional — kind guy rarely meet. said things I’ve always wanted hear: crush me, wanted take somewhere special, loved little drawings made, could picture us together. exchanged playlists, comics, voice notes. felt genuine. Somewhere deep down, suspected might love bombing. wanted believe.. planned meet day, stood up. said he’d fainting episode still hospital — intern — messaged late enough already vulnerable told really looking forward seeing him. that, things changed. stopped replying often. tone shifted. claimed still sick, stayed active online, reacting selfies, ignoring actual messages. unmatched me, still didn’t follow back insta, even asked. follower count kept changing. strange. thought probably hitting 5 girls time. Still, stayed patient. gave space. Eventually asked gently still wanted meet. dodged question. told okay wasn’t anymore — wanted honesty. reply? “You know I’m hospital, sleep lot” (I didn’t.)

Since breaking ex, I’ve least 15 dates. conversation, spark want see again. others ghosted me. It’s disheartening. don’t want casual flings. want something meaningful. keep finding people either don’t want — pretend care, disappear. friends told stop dating apps , truth meet worst relationships there, met real life, looks like same. don’t know. guess needed get chest. wish place could find someone cute, wants girlfriend interests.. never seems come together.","dating","relationships"

Apologies it’s little place, it’s while. quite long. Last summer met guy dating app (I 19F time, 20M). hit right away, within days talking, decided meet. came picked up, drove around talking listening music, pulled parking lot got little freaky (nothing crazy), drove home. first meeting, continued talk afterwards. quickly got pretty close, texted every day, took get nails done nail salon mother owns, ended meeting family (mom, dad, younger siblings) there. within first week meeting btw. wasn’t expecting meet family quickly, seemed okay thought nothing it. felt great connection, could see things going somewhere. went small dates, would sometimes bring food visit work, would go drives, etc. get sexual pretty frequently, felt right. never went way, get picture. one night picked work, sat car hours talking. ended telling ex, literally cried arms missed cats ex kept him. comforted without question, saw bonding moment. Besides, like guys aren’t afraid show feelings, didn’t turn all. days later, actually bought cat plushy this, put car display window. two weeks consistent talking, took date movies. made paper flower bouquet, picked up, lot fun movie. parents town, went back place afterwards, spent night. connection felt great, awkward moments sexual stuff (I virgin), everything felt great slept together comfortably. next day (Sunday) drove home work, everything continued usual. day (Monday) sent good morning message always did, didn’t get back me. waited hours, assuming sleeping, started get worried. called bit later, knowing always awake time, rang times call declined. started getting anxious, texted saw read messages. knew immediately something wrong. began stressing out, time texted back could tell something off. eventually got tell going on, put simply, told felt moving quickly feeling stressed it. told completely understood, asked wanted slow things down, said yes. agreed keep casual. next days, felt like avoiding me. wouldn’t get back hours, barely engaged conversation, ghosted times often wouldn’t respond next day. felt miserable thought really something, seemed like gone. days this, enough told made feel, asked wanted done me. said no, wanted casual now. before. ended calling point told really needed talk, told stuff phone. end smiling laughing, realized nothing changed. that, texting exact same, still felt like didn’t care. point, I’d enough (again) told I’d taking break texting felt ignored. agreed apologized, went week without texting him. finally came back, responses same. Took hours sometimes full day reply, barely engaged. Later day (maybe next day, can’t remember) texted saying done ignored cast aside, wanted done say instead leaving hanging. sent long messages explaining made feel, told confused changed, wasn’t even acting like wanted friends. wanted honest me, wanted nothing fine, lead on. last messages, never responded me. felt heartbroken despite knowing short time, felt like idiot getting attached quickly. week two later messaged let know would dropping hoodie left place, again, response. packed shit bag drove house. left porch, left. driving away, noticed car still cat plushy bought dash, broke sobbing way home. texted let know dropped things off, went home. never replied me, know read message long left left read receipts on. Anyways, don’t know maybe came strong, maybe stressed much cared, seemed blue. put much effort did, more. introduced family first, initiated late night drives, surprised work time, initiated almost sexual acts, seemed like everything switched single day. told wasn’t ready relationship, told fine could keep casual, discussed night cried arms. told pressure could go flow, why? Sorry long. It’s like 8 months I’m obviously, closure would’ve nice. Even though didn’t know long, never felt like anyone, felt special, maybe I’m naive. opinions insight would appreciated. TLDR: Guy seeing involved caring, randomly decided wanted friends ghosting entirely. Edit: adding feel it’s important detail — asked originally wrong, also asked done something, wasn’t feeling anymore, clearly said things. said cared me, hadn’t done anything wrong. said cried bed thinking night mind. also told point people pleaser, part thinks may scared tell truth hurt feelings something, don’t know.

However, I’ve noticed many Muslim apologists online users cite passages parts Bible—texts fall outside Torah the first five books Hebrew Scriptures Gospel. examples Isaiah 29, Isaiah 42, Song Solomon 5. questions: 1. citing passages unaware part historically established Torah? 2. believe books included broader definition “Torah,” therefore view part Allah’s divine revelation? fully understand Muslim might appeal texts like Deuteronomy Gospel John, since could fit within Quran’s framework I disagree Muhammad there, that’s another topic. it’s much harder see citing, let’s say Romans Jude New Testament, makes less sense citing Isaiah— neither would align Quran’s stated criteria.

"Two-Monkey Paradox: Theory Human Evolution Thinking **The Two-Monkey Paradox: Theory Human Evolution Thinking** Imagine two monkeys. monkeys trying evolve, go different ways. One monkey focuses improving thinking process. works making smarter, faster, efficient understanding world solving problems. monkey always trying enhance way thinks reason, believing thinks, better able adapt. second monkey, hand, isn’t focused improving thinking directly. Instead, focuses improving process evolution itself. monkey believes evolve ability evolve — figure improve process change — become infinitely better long run. focuses evolving mind methods growth, keep getting smarter, faster, capable without getting stuck fixed way thinking. Now, big question is: **Which monkey would smarter long period time?** first monkey works hard think better, it’s limited framework it’s using. improve thoughts, stays within cycle improvement — improving thinking *in way* it’s always done. second monkey, though, working evolving way evolves. always shifting mindset become adaptable, flexible, capable self-improvement. time, second monkey likely outgrow first, it’s improving within fixed system; it’s changing system improvement itself. **The Human Mindset Today: Monkey We?** Now, think humanity today, ask: **Which monkey mindset living with?** 2025, humans follow first monkey’s path. work hard make thinking better — whether it’s improving knowledge, refining skills, solving problems. time, don’t focus improving improve ourselves. stuck cycle thinking more, working more, striving become smarter within methods we’ve always known. why, many, life feels like repetitive grind — work, retire, maybe enjoy life. enjoyment often seen separate reward, something part work process itself. However, people think like second monkey. individuals focus improving ability improve — think evolve process growth. understand it’s enough simply work hard; must find ways make growth effective adaptable. people constantly seeking new ways learn, grow, change mindset, understanding evolution isn’t result — it’s journey becoming better. **Why Matter?** humanity thought like second monkey, things would much easier. process growth wouldn’t rigid. People wouldn’t trapped constant cycle grinding survive seeking fleeting moments joy. Instead, could build systems growth enjoyment *always* connected, evolution isn’t slow, painful climb, continuous, adaptable process. issue people still stuck first monkey's mindset — focusing make thinking better without questioning they’re improving thinking first place. leads frustration, burnout, feeling trapped endless loop. theory, humans ""nerfed"" — potential limited way we’ve structured growth development. We’re constantly trying catch ever-evolving world, without truly evolving way evolve. second monkey, though, cracked code. mindset continuous, adaptable evolution. It’s thinking ways make growth efficient fluid. mindset could key unlocking humanity’s true potential, everything — work, growth, joy — exist continuous, harmonious flow. **So, Monkey You?** we’ve laid theory, it’s time ask: **Which monkey identify with?** first monkey, stuck cycle thinking trying get better methods? second monkey, always looking ways evolve process evolution? Think next time you’re working problem trying improve yourself. making thinking better way always have, trying evolve way improve yourself? end, choice yours. power move first monkey's mindset second. start thinking *how* you’re thinking evolving thinking get better evolving itself. core theory. challenging conventional ways improve creating new path growth, one focuses evolving process growth itself. humanity embraced second monkey mindset, possibilities would endless.","cogsci","science"

Would probably want resort stay least one nights (if region good that). * Fly back Buenos Aires 15 November one last full day returning home. renting cars region outside Buenos Aires travel. open least considering Mendoza, Ushuaia, maybe Iguazu, end suited towards group.

Maybe take day go see Trollfjord area. Upshot: pretty area, hopefully good photo opportunities. Downshot: possible crowds I get feeling sights become Instagram fatality - best avoid sort places, expensive, hikes may challenging skill level. checked hotels seem available, ditto car rentals although car rentals cheap \- Abisko: twice photograph aurora, recently February.

"Trip Report: Poland, Czechia Ukraine Quick preface - Polish National left child back. done another trip report  journey around Morocco. Around Warsaw foot got Flixbus Lublin bought motorbike. Biked farm, around small towns, Prague back Poland. Bike waiting mechanic took side quest Lviv bus Kyiv night train back Lublin bus. **Warsaw early March** Arrived Warsaw smooth flight got bus New World hostel easily. hostel sucked massively though. one desk turned managed remotely. Eventually checked went really long walk, old town, back along Wisla river. gotta say, tough day me. Despite walk pretty weather decent, feeling lonely. hostel full Indian Ukrainian migrant workers speak Polish, English sat bubbles quite hard make friends explore with. top that, recently broken ex home country kept reminding context wanting show around, share food, culture on. pretty much spent rest day evening walking around going back hostel going sleep. Feet hurt walking nice. Switched hostels next day Oki Doki - loved it got advice friendly reception lady do. Visited Castle Museum surprisingly fun Chopin Museum solid, interactive. Tried first bar mleczny say mid. Tbh, expected it, kinda overpriced old town food kinda bland. evening joined hostel cooking class made friends travellers Australia, US, Denmark, places. Went drinking ended night quietly throwing hostel loo going sleep. Next day, three guys hostel I, explored Warsaw Uprising Museum amazing interactive, showed new friends joys Polish food milk bar this one near Uprising museum actually great, food price wise, hit Palace Culture view kinda overpriced nice spot chill. Took trip see river mermaid statue. went back hostel, kebabs went drinking. guys started hitting girls bar, kinda felt like 7th wheel said bye left. Turns pretty interesting nights really stories tell. Final day, walked around old town one guys going Łazienki Park sad missed it run catch FlixBus town. interlude, stayed family, surgery, saw dentist bunch medical stuff. Private healthcare crazy cheap Poland. **Czech Farm Stay early mid-April** Spent nearly two weeks volunteering family farm Czechia. days would start 7:30 feeding animals. that, would breakfast mum, sometimes look kids bit 1.5 5 years old go whatever days work was. revolved around cleaning stables, moving compost piles, moving hay, moving wood, garden work house chores. would usually go lunch around 1-2pm. lunch would either baby sit bit time dad came back work would help couple hours not everyday though tbh. Sometimes evenings would also help cooking babysitting. Saw goat give birth, helped goat slaughter actually really unique experience. said, pretty full-on times felt like much work volunteer setup. food nice exactly protein loaded physical work doing. WiFi reach room made difficult side project brutally honest, hated kids. stop screaming sunrise, way past sunset. Took short day trips nearby towns like Bouzov castle, Olomouc bit underwhelming, Brno wandered, worked cafes. Brno pretty chilled. Lodging food provided, like said kids drove mental workload felt unbalanced. Eventually tapped left farm. **Prague late April** Arrived Prague Dream Hostel - solid farm mixed time. Gorgeous city great weather, felt bit lonely despite nice chat English lad hostel. Felt bit headachy realised haven’t drank anything since morning stopped beer lol. Walked around old town, walked across Charles Bridge went castle. Walked around grounds. Drove around bit, got food deli can't remember name, really nice way overpriced sandwich. Drove back hostel, chilled went Letna park bit. lonely blues hit bit again, lots couples enjoying sunset... Chilled bit went back hostel. Went bar hostel, met English guy dutch couple. Chatted bit going bed pounding headache cos dehydrated. Next day weather great walked city centre had tram hesitations around buying tickets packed tram, head sat cafe work. Struggled pick cafe sit again, head okay end. Eventually walked back hostel, work bar ended really good night. English bloke seemed people magnet ended 15-20 us drinking, chatting getting know eachother. **Lodz Weekend late April** Rode Prague Lodz meet friend made going farm. Horrible ride: freezing, rain, visibility nearly ran petrol. Totally worth it. Spent wholesome weekend walking around Lodz, visiting planetarium film exhibition EC1 culture centre thingy, eating Indian Thai, chilling cafes parks. Enjoyed Manufaktura shoping centre converted textile factory believe. piotrkowska st quite nice tbqh three things city imo. **Lviv, Ukraine early May** Booked coach hostel impulse. spending time relatively close border, waiting bike go mechanics next adventure, not. English bloke Prague hostel come back recomended well. knowing one Putin’s goals erase Ukrainian identity culture made learning feel like giving finger. Tbh though think war tourism also little it. get bit later. Border crossing chaotic, bus almost left without went pee. First impressions Lviv kind reminded Lublin 20 years ago. Beautiful architecture, horrible traffic walkable. Got caught ordering beer getting whole fish it. Kind freaked bit, know ended man handling best could. Met hostel guests, including Foreign Legion hopeful found Foreign Legion much higher casulty rate around 80% Ukrainian brigades loud English guy wouldn’t shut controversial politics. Walked Lychakiv cemetery saw lot old graves some fancy newer graves. Amongst newer ones mother three kids killed strike year prior. first thought here. Right next Lychakiv Memorial Heroes Ukraine. second time thought there. sea Ukranian flags, black red Ukrainian flag covered blood flags brigade flags. really hit home human cost invasion. soldiers nevermind civillians. part really wanted get picture, incredible sight families visiting graves thought would poor taste. Visited open-air museum meh, went chill park, think everything. walk back bumped political English kid ended going volunteer making tea rations soldiers babushkas basement. went bar met Brit ex-lawyer turned Lviv resident. recomended skipping Kyiv going Kharkiv instead. echoed super cool but lowkey crazy Kiwi guy met hostel. already anxious Kyiv 9th, Soviet victory WW2 worried Russia would make bombing it, booked night train Kharkiv impulse. Right left night train Kyiv, met old Polish man military arguably talked sense or rather scared it advised going Kharkiv daily air raids. cancelled train. **Kyiv early mid-May** Kyiv intense sobering. Arrived night train. Saw major sights: Independence Square, Lavra complex, Holodomor memorial, war museum, Motherland statue. many men military uniforms, lot crutches. Multiple scam attempts girls handing ribbons. Mostly walked took city. Went Puzata Hata times cheap local food. Wanted go Musafir one time stupidly, picked Saturday afternoon packed pussied out. Got know American kid hostel broke Ukrainian military paid him, shit time, trying figure life out. Bought beers groceries, warned pretentious NGO worker also hostel guest, left bad taste. Kyiv different Lviv. Multilane roads steep hills felt like SF Lviv much walkable. underpasses beneath main roads around Maidan doubled dense arcades flower stalls, cafés, bookshops tucked beneath city. get chance: go. Spend money local businesses. Listen people’s stories. Support economy way can. Ukrainians warm, generous, many feel forgotten. **Highlights:** * Polish museums Warsaw * goat slaughter farm life when babysitting * Brno solo cafe work day * Volunteering Lviv * Kyiv’s war memorials Lavra complex **Downsides:** * hostel guests loud, political, annoying * Farm workload imbalance * Feeling lonely travelling solo times * Rainy ride Lodz **Overall Rating:** 9/10 Wild range experiences. farm gave manual work reflection, Lodz gave good company, Ukraine gave perspective. Would again, bit planning fewer kids.","solotravel","travel"

"Trip report: 3 months across China #Itinerary Week 1: Beijing +Chengde Week 2: Xian +Luoyang, Chengdu Week 3: Chongqing, Zhangjiajie +Fenghuang Week 4: Nanjing, Huangshan, Hangzhou Week 5: Shanghai +Wuxi, Suzhou Week 6: Hong Kong, Yangshuo Week 7-8: Yunnan Kunming, Dali, Lijiang +Shaxi, Tiger Leaping Gorge Week 9: Break Week 10-11: Qinghai Xining, Tongren Gansu Xiahe, Lanzhou, Zhangye, Jiyuaguan, Dunhuang Week 12: Guangzhou, Shenzhen #Background: * consider fairly well-traveled, China ~70th country. expectations experiences traveling China could differ mind * aim trip report provide balanced viewpoint travel experience China. people really talk they’re shocked cleanliness efficiency things developed country is, that’s one small piece entire travel experience. also generally find trip reports lacking people never really talk less superb. So, want focus areas feel less discussed many people online #Initial Thoughts: * Firstly, want say think China favorite travel experience East Asia one favorite overall. country much offer. find inherently fun figure quirks differences things operate here. cultural differences stark unlike anywhere I’ve seen around world. China completely foreign world it’s almost entirely closed west somewhat recently * Overall, I’d rate traveling China relatively easy grand scheme things, difficult “mainstream” destinations. hard sense navigate language tech ecosystem barrier. figure more latter, travel ultra convenient. rapidly growing domestic tourism industry advancement technology really made things easy manage. Chinese people value convenience lot domestic travel convenient result. There’s service way get anything go anywhere want. * disregard almost everything know country haven’t 10+ years. China changing fast, trends come go like wildfire here. 10-20+ years ago, fake European replica landmarks sights popular, since peaked. 5+ years, wouldn’t surprised travel experience changes significantly something else vogue #Tips * last year, Chinese government simplified travel significantly granting visa-free travel certain situations TWOV 30 days certain countries. apps got much user-friendly, allowing tourists set WeChat / Alipay foreign cards even land. There’s even on-screen translation English versions many apps you’ll use. I’ll say figure WeChat / Alipay, everything else falls place travel becomes easy. literally didn’t use cash ~3 months here, including rural areas * Apps found useful aside payment ones: Amap Google Maps alternative, LetsVPN you need VPN access anything western, DeepSeek better AI tools since it’s actually trained Chinese sources, Railway12306 train bookings, Meituan for deliveries, Dianping similar Yelp, also gives coupons discounts restaurants <— always check deals sit-down places since actually get ton off, Trip.com hotels flights, CTrip local tours carpool options rural areas * simplicity’s sake, use Trip.com everything China: hotels, train tickets, flights, attraction tickets if want avoid navigating bunch different WeChat / Alipay pages. There’s zero problems OTAs China it’s extremely reliable platform. I’ve bought domestic flights facilitated refunds quickly them. You’ll likely forced using domestic flights point anyway, since Chinese flight websites total ass many flights don’t even show Google Flights #The Good: * think people outdated picture China like nowadays. country changed lot last 20, 10, 5, even 2+ years half wrote probably outdated next years. Public spaces China extraordinarily clean 2025. Food quality, sanitation, cleanliness improved lot, especially pandemic according friends people I’ve met here. Chinese tourists actually much well-behaved domestically ones I’ve seen abroad. Even travel experience much easier even year ago. * Everything conveniently accessed phone systems China talk other. Even something like metro cards public transit payment systems would usually difficult different systems different cities countries centralized here. Whenever go new city, switch transport cards automatically Alipay start using immediately * Accommodation standards high everywhere country, even remote places, good hotels present. punch way weight class terms cleanliness amenities. There’s big surplus hotels across price ranges, even cheaper hotels good * China strongest consumer rights I’ve seen country. Mostly everything travel-related buy attraction tickets, flights, train tickets, hotels refunded exchanged easily apps. fighting customer service get refunds processed. allowed ultimate flexibility planning trip making last second changes weather wasn’t good decided change itinerary * Safe. Literally worry leaving bags valuables somewhere public using phones open which changed lot last decade, heard petty crime used rampant even mid 2010s. friends tell sexual harassment towards women isn’t even worry, can’t personally attest * Chinese people warm, curious, helpful. find sociable open locals Eastern Asian countries. Chinese people found foreigner I’m Asian, it’s obvious first glance, eager wanting learn I’m from. also found incredibly patient helpful even you’re talking translator app, people willing full convos via translator * truly incredibly diverse country huge ranges food, landscapes, activities country. think there’s something everyone here, regardless travel preferences #Considerations: * language barrier huge still main problem traveling here. IMO, it’s biggest problem comes food. Going restaurant QR codes tables easiest since take long want translate parse actual menu photos, choose want, pay everything that. you’ll inevitably run many restaurants there’s option. Places large, vague menus photos order front. found scenarios difficult since it’s like open translation app full conversation someone ask questions even prices there’s line people behind you. you’re staying mostly cities, option sticking food courts restaurants around malls avoid — there’s tons options, they’re likely easy straightforward way order. * topic dining, found somewhat difficult solo traveler. Chinese culture heavily emphasizes family style dining. Solo dining limits order fairly significantly. It’s hard try bunch things you’re sharing multiple dishes others set meals come enough food multiple people. It’s also much expensive per dish basis eating others * second biggest hurdle travel whole tech ecosystem. essentially learn use whole new suite apps since China versions, may English translations. * Things really crowded here. Obviously, there’s billion people living here. mostly went shoulder season even then, strategically plan going sights even sort popular weekends couldn’t get tickets certain things museums. can’t imagine much shitshow it’d actual busy season. There’s avoiding crowds * Travel takes longer you’d think. Public transit speed trains good, attractions sometimes really spread out, traffic make things take lot longer. Even ordering food buying tickets attractions sometimes add material amount time day fumble translating things navigating new screens WeChat / Alipay * Tourism really figured tee especially standard tourist loop people Beijing-Xian-Chengdu-Zhangjiajie-Shanghai. places nature configured accessible ages types people. means “hiking” paths like walking paths might completely paved steps. You’ll likely following pre-determined paths get whisked away stop stop bus, shuttle, cable car. Cultural sights historical areas often times feel bit kitschy since cater domestic tourism much point you’re entirely surrounded tourist-oriented businesses atmosphere curated specifically posted social media. Basically, lot historical cultural stuff even remotely interesting commercialized ass. You’ll see photo frames, fake flower hallways, fake statues, saturation LED lights, oddly placed lanterns dragons, fog machines lakes, hanfu businesses every storefront, etc. * clarify, I’m using “touristy” synonym something that’s popular like Paris, London, even Venice. I’m using describe something feels manufactured curated, like rice terraces Bali, Hoi old town, hand bridge Da Nang. Hoi actually good comparison most, “ancient town” scenic areas China * people could call “inauthentic,” “artificial,” “touristy,” would even agree extent, that’s nature travel here, something make peace with, skip China. isn’t something usually problem anywhere else world I actually find cringe hell people complain stuff, China kick another gear it’s worth mentioning since know people aversion kind stuff. all, likely lot people everywhere go nothing really feels low-key radar since everything already “developed.” * Fairly difficult go beaten path unless devote lot time it. Even traveling independently, feels like travel “guardrails” things feel *too* convenient times lack adventurousness, particular nature-y spots. There’s little risk missing transfers, getting lost, unprepared, going hungry since travel idiotproof majority country * visit enough cities China, start feel mostly same. Chinese cities developed recent decades, leading urban design across them. urban layout, buildings, LED lights skyscrapers, types businesses, etc. Cities oftentimes feel copy pasted, differentiators cultural landmarks unique city. lot feel sterile lacking distinct personality result * Weirdly, depending see pro con think debated ways, believe little China, relative many sights are, truly “must see.” see two-fold. 1: there’s much see skip lot still packed itinerary things good better. 2: also see China ton offer that’s decent good, really many things super mind-blowing doesn’t require invest lot time getting there. country sights somewhat high floor, low ceiling, words. someone could say almost anything skippable wouldn’t argue it. don’t think there’s ton singular places activities overwhelmingly fantastic *have* see #Itinerary: Note: I’m saying place skippable since I’m thinking perspective someone weeks travel China might want prioritize biggest best things. Every place went enjoyable added holistic experience China me, everyone months travel country * Beijing: One places China think actually must anyone, regardless interests. first trip China complete without visit here, IMO. One historically significant culturally important cities world. main sights e.g. Great Wall, Summer Palace, Forbidden City among best country. Beihai Park overlooked spot don’t see lot mention foreigners, I’d say it’s must. * Xian: enjoyed city lot, there’s lot see eat. think it’s one best historical big cities China. think Terracotta Army bit overrated since still can’t get really close statues logistics getting bit cumbersome. honestly don’t think actually person adds huge amount marginal value. Xian still worth visit even disregarding Terracotta Army * Chengdu: panda center highlight time China, find city great tourism. It’s got bit laid back charm artsy feel Chinese cities typically don’t have, many standout specific sights see. People always say Chengdu nice kick back enjoy vibes, type thing isn’t something personally would prioritize limited vacation time. Whether visit solely hinges much priority pandas * Chongqing: One unique cities I’ve ever seen city-est city I’ve ever life. urban architecture layout city bonkers. ton energy liveliness here. night magnitudes better daytime. great place wander around aimlessly standout specific sites either, doesn’t really matter IMO. city looks feels distinct personality, fairly rare Chinese city * Zhangjiajie + Huangshan: actually better expected seen million times photos. scale magnitude you’ll see person far greater. I’d say they’re musts, it’s dependent feel crowds, paved steps, “developed” nature, mentioned * Nanjing: hung mainly needed kill days. relatively typical Chinese city, unless penchant history would enjoy historical museums sights. Interesting read you’re there, nonetheless. priority * Hangzhou: Unless deep fascination understanding Chinese literature, West Lake another scenic lake you, rather crowded one that. actually experienced worst traffic China areas surrounding area. find here, really enjoyed hiking mountain views nearby tea plantation hills lake itself. There’s lot large green spaces make city unique compared Chinese cities. Overall, fairly enjoyable, lake * Shanghai: enjoyed Shanghai lot, think it’s incredibly beautiful city, contrary others, would personally recommend remove days places shoehorn itinerary unless you’re already using transit hub. It’s Western / international city, novelty seeing China modernized westernized recent decades walking amongst city skyline, would prioritize “Chinese” city visit it’s either/or decision. also don’t think Suzhou worth going way for. gardens canals okay. already Shanghai, yes, Suzhou worth visit * Hong Kong: There’s always lot pessimism HK brought online it’s changed lot. mean it’s somewhat true extent, it’s something tourist would even notice visit lasts days. I’d say still go. enjoyed city’s urban design edginess lot, it’s still got distinctly unique personality sets apart mainland * Yangshuo: It’s popular half-day river cruise Guilin Yangshuo rent scooter ride around countryside days. similar feeling Ha Long Bay Ninh Binh Vietnam. enjoyed time lot since could explore nature get away crowds. absolute best scooter riding I’ve done Asia, still pretty enjoyable different experience rest China. Riding Xianggong viewpoint best thing here. I’d recommend visit. * Yunnan Kunming, Dali, Lijiang, Tiger Leaping Gorge, Shangri-La, Yubeng: Insanely popular among domestic tourists result, verrrrrry touristy Dali Lijiang theme park-esque ancient towns there. Somewhat easy get away all, though. Rent scooter ride around Erhai Lake Dali. Spend day Shaxi quieter village. Tiger Leaping Gorge good hike one that’s actually nature without paved steps. It’s possible one day, 2-3 like others say. Jade Dragon Snow Mountain embodies Chinese experience nature fully — get whisked place place via shuttle cable car paved steps entire way. Views still good, though. * Guangzhou: IMO, one underrated cities China western travel perspective. Guangzhou doesn’t many specific sights, energy level really great one best mainland cities. me, closest comparison mainland HK. There’s lots similarities culture, urban design, food, hustle bustle. Guangzhou also certain level grittiness, edginess, character, old school personality, relative lack sterility lot Chinese cities have. feels lot like cities SEA chaos street food/businesses see around * Shenzhen: boring big city China it’s young lot history it’s sterile much separates city. electronics market draws people even someone enjoys tinkering playing around gadgets tech, it’s half day day long thing best. wouldn’t even recommend staying day unless you’re transiting through. even day trip Guangzhou HK worth unless you’re *really* interested tech * Qinghai Xining, Tongren: Tibetan province outside Tibet. You’re actually fairly limited go foreigner. towns Delingha either outright prevent staying, can’t visit scenic sights Golmud without Chinese ID. even police visit hotel check me, lol. Worth visiting interest Tibetan culture, don’t want shell mandatory tour Tibet. part country least touristy whole trip, even domestic tourists. still saw group tours, though * Gansu Xiahe, Lanzhou, Zhangye, Jiayuguan, Dunhuang: really enjoyed Gansu lot, particularly Zhangye. views vastly different see Eastern China, lot rugged dry landscapes. food lot different too. Even go west, still run issue regards touristy nature-y sights crowded set convenience. certainly beaten path westerners, still busy domestic tourists. Since things much spread here, recommend signing carpools getting drivers sights Ctrip. #Conclusion: * me, China country embodies peak travel experience offers whole experience: learning opportunities, interesting culture history, good infrastructure, well-designed clean cities, good nature, virtually unlimited diverse food options, convenience. would whole heartedly recommend many people, things could dealbreakers many others * importantly, think it’s rewarding travel experience country challenge almost every preconceived notion it. Even someone knew good amount country culture trip, found coming learned lot, especially came people. * like China lot specifically able deep dive it. weeks standard loop Beijing Shanghai, don’t think would’ve liked nearly much. every place, even places said skippable part whole China experience added overall enjoyment country. would even argue it’s slow burn country takes extended period time multiple visits everything really click truly transformative. * someone ask first time visit itinerary, would suggest something along lines of: Beijing > Xian > Chongqing / Chengdu > Zhangjiajie / Huangshan / Yangshuo > HK / Shanghai / Guangzhou * I’ll coming back China another months later summer see Xinjiang, western Sichuan, northern Yunnan, Tibet. probably another write-up then.","solotravel","travel"

"Sri Lanka trip report dec 2024 post six months late. husband travelled Sri Lanka 12 days last December wanted share itinerary experience. booked cab driver, charged us flat rate 600 euros whole duration. options came across also charging similar rates. Food prices varied lot. pricier beach areas, Mirissa. Nuwara Eliya went pizza place, like tourist prices restaurants normal. Kandy normal prices. itinerary looked something like this: Day 1: Flight Sri Lanka. Pick cab. Stop Colombo lunch drive Hikkaduwa. Getting Colombo crazy, mainly due traffic, took lot longer expected. Also planned stopping Colombo looking city, felt like worth stop... especially someone coming India. cleanliness, footpaths! love, awe. time reached Hikkaduwa already dark past 7pm. ETA google maps quite accurate. continued rest trip. Day 2: Hikkaduwa. really sure Hikkaduwa, quite popular travel circuit instagram stuff, think old tourist spot. Checked turtle beach area reef area nearby. Lots lots hawkers, trying sell seaweed turtles snorkel masks boat trips.. rate ask way line. definitely haggle bit. got bit cloudy evening, although rain. Day 3: Hikkaduwa, trial scuba diving morning. like it, beach super crowded, left went Narigama beach chilled there. Rained evening, quite heavily. Day 4: Drive Mirissa. way stopped see Galle stopped Rumssala Peace Pagoda near Unawatuna. reached Mirissa sun down. Galle really nice, could easily spend whole day there, roaming sights artsy shops. Also great restaurants. peace pagoda Day 5: Went whale watching morning (spotted whale!). Returned afternoon. Went Mirissa beach spent rest day there. Day 6: Mirissa beach, coconut tree hill, that. Mirissa seemed little pricey Hikka. beach/waves rough, even though went water time would massive forceful one people would clear water it. smaller waves okay. also lot russians Hikka, crowd Mirissa seemed varied.. somehow, felt hip. was, perhaps, vibe place. beach clubs parties evening, go any. Day 7: Drive Nuwara Eliya. reached Ella lunch time. lunch checked Ravana's cave nine arch bridge continuing drive. reached Nuwara Eliya 8pm. Day 8: Nuwara Eliya. Horton Plains plan kinda tuckered took easy, went Seethamman Kovil Hakkagala garden lovely. afternoon, checked lake coffee cafe went back hotel. Day 9: Drive Kandy. Stopped Ramboda falls way. Reached Kandy afternoon, lunch city center. Walked around lake market area checking in. Day 10: Sigiriya Dambulla caves. ended Saturday, quite crowded. Also started early morning pretty much took whole day. Day 11: Relaxed hotel. Went Udawatta Kele Sanctuary walked trail. left there, started raining, anything else. Day 12: Checked hotel, went Temple museums there. took whole morning. grabbed quick lunch drove airport catch flight. first time planning international trip, got bit carried away various places see, would recommend skipping much. energy levels waned time reached Day 7. But... everything absolutely beautiful. natural beauty Sri Lanka truly something else, forests, mountains beaches spectacular. Ella gets attention, really liked Nuwara Eliya. people kind well. food close south indian quite similar terms flavours. Entrance fees foreigners pricey again, get concession Sigiriya SAARC country (carry passport!). comfortable trip, say pick maybe 2-3 places add time places. like checked Colombo, even though see Galle bit rushed started late day.. little time hand would nice. think exploring south west beach belt would great holiday well. spending time mountains would good too. reason went Kandy see Sigiriya Dambulla. safaris because.. preferred going Yala little way route, dropped it.","travel","travel"

Malaga (Spain) 6. San Sebastian (Spain) 7. Bilbao (Spain) 8. Nice (France) 9. Bordeux (France) 10. Lyon (France) reason picked convinience, flights Morocco after. terms travel criteria, generally base on: Food Culture (big driver me, good food key - doesnt expensive good), Visual Charm (I DSLR use take photos city,streetscapes, architecture, colorful details, warm, earthy scenes historic feel etc), Local vibe/culture (just feeling town/city uniqueness place, enjoy walking around), essentially value money luxury travel (4 5 star hotels). definitely looking party boozy trip. factor weather (but end all) - want cold (really 4/5 degree lows, fine freezing cold weather). seem fit within criteria part.

Since plan head straight Sapa next morning, didn’t book hotel Hanoi night. Landed Hanoi 2 am, immigration queue took 1 hour waited airport. Day 1 – Hanoi Sapa landing Hanoi early morning, 7 took sleeper bus(Sao Viet) Sapa (around 6 hours). reached Sapa early afternoon, checked hotel, pho lunch, spent rest day exploring town. Hotel booked close Sapa Station. visited Sun Plaza, Cat Cat Village, enjoyed cool mountain weather. evening relaxed—we explored local market tried street food Vietnamese milk coffee Day 2 – Fansipan Return Hanoi checked early left luggage hotel. Headed Fansipan, highest peak Indochina. cable car ride views stunning, though quite windy cloudy top. Pre-booked tickets via klook. coming back Sapa town evening, dinner boarded sleeper bus back Hanoi. Day 3 – Ha Long Bay Day Cruise reached Hanoi early morning 5 am, kept bags hotel, rested hours. picked full-day Ha Long Bay cruise, pre-booked via klook. included bamboo boat ride, seafood lunch board, visiting Ti Top Island. returned Hanoi evening walked around Old Quarter, grabbed dinner coffee, got USD exchanged VND finally checked-into hotel. Day 4 – Ninh Binh Day Trip full-day tour Ninh Binh covered Mua Caves hike, Trang boat ride Bai Dinh Pagoda, visit ancient capital, Hoa Lu. Booked trip via Klook, bus picked us 7 hotel. one favorite days—peaceful, green, different big city buzz. returned Hanoi around 7 PM spent evening shopping night market around Hoan Kiem lake. Day 5 – Hanoi Da Nang checked morning, left luggage hotel, spent relaxed hours exploring Old Quarter. tried banh mi, egg coffee, shopped souvenirs Dong Xuan Market. evening, flew Hanoi Da Nang checked hotel midnight. Day 6 – Ba Na Hills Golden Bridge spent whole day Ba Na Hills. Booked trip klook, shuttle bus pickup drop. Golden Bridge impressive entire resort felt like theme park. returned Da Nang evening explored riverside area. also visited Michelin star restaurant nearby try Banh Xeo dinner. Day 7 – Hoi checking Da Nang hotel, visited Han Market explore souvenirs, Mi Quang noodles lunch took Grab Hoi (around 45 minutes). spent day exploring Ancient Town—very charming lantern-lit streets historical buildings. evening, lantern boat ride river tried local dishes like cao lau white rose dumplings.

Day 9 – Flight Back Bangalore checked morning headed airport noon flight back Bangalore. end truly memorable trip. tips “wish-we-had” moments 1. Don’t underestimate travel time Sapa. Even though limousine buses comfy, 6-hour journey way eats quite bit time. one day, would’ve spent extra night Sapa soak vibe without rushing. 2. Vietnam runs early starts! tours pick 7:30–8:00 AM. One day literally jumping tour van half asleep overnight bus. ideal. Give breathing space you’re back-to-back excursions. 3. Pack weather types. Sapa cool misty, Hanoi hot humid, Da Nang blazing sun. light raincoat, sunblock, breathable clothes saved us once. 4. Fireworks Festival awesome, get early. reached time super crowded. better views, go early even consider watching riverside rooftop café find one. chose go Song Han bridge. 5. Carry small change street food tips. Vendors taxis often struggle break big notes. made habit break VND 500k notes supermarkets cafés first thing morning. 6. you’re packed itinerary food adventures, helps carry basic medicines motion sickness, upset stomach, cold/fever, etc. Sapa’s winding roads make people queasy. 7. Buying SIM airport saviour going directly Sapa. Airport wifi unreliable would need network track bus pick details/updates. Buy SIM overall data pack per-day plan, cafes, restaurants hotels would wifi. talktime needed communicate grab via chat itself. 8. Water cost something pile end. 500ml bottle 10.000 20.000 VND. places, expected buy water. 9. Try look hotels include breakfast. Starting days heavy breakfast nimble street foods throughout day, helped us stay within budget. anyone planning similar route questions logistics, buses, flights, places stay, feel free ask. Happy help!","travel","travel"

"2013 VW Polo 1.2 TDI – Juddering Engine Braking Despite Extensive Repairs Hi everyone, I’m facing persistent juddering issue 2013 Volkswagen Polo 1.2 TDI (Diesel, 3-cylinder, manual). car judders noticeably engine braking—especially lower gears low RPMs—when lift accelerator. Interestingly, judder subsides press release clutch. warning lights, engine runs smoothly otherwise, good mileage stalling pulling issues. past weeks, I’ve replaced engine gearbox mounts (including dogbone), lower arms, brake pads, clutch components, driveshafts, even throttle position sensor. I’ve also swapped gearbox flywheel. Tyres new alignment done. Yet, issue persists. far, everything mechanical seems covered, I’m wondering timing kit (belt/chain tensioner), ECU mapping deceleration, internal gearbox/chassis dynamics could culprit. vibrations present engine braking—no throttle input. really appreciate technical insights, particularly anyone experienced similar behavior. thoughts hidden causes next steps deeper internal diagnosis would great help.
