Let's assume average 1,200 pounds, higher end line. American lion roughly 1.2 meters shoulder, 2.5 meters long . coastal grizzly, comparison, stood 1.3 meters shoulder, 2.4 meters long  course, grizzly could get lot bigger standing hind legs, 3 meters tall. American lion roughly 2,800 Newton bite force, bear roughly 1,500 Newton bite force. Also, keep mind lion's teeth better designed combat bear's, meaning lion takes clear edge field. seem information arm strength American lion, given grizzly bear longer claws weight, safe say bear much deadlier paw. Surprisingly, bear reach speed 30-40 mph, lion reach 30mph. Granted, movement speed important fight; attack speed agility matter. Given lion cat, pretty obvious cat takes edge agility arguably combat speed. American lion's diet mostly consisted large animals like bison, deer, even mammoths, bear's diet mostly fish berries. Additionally, American lions coexisted interacted short-faced bear, grizzly bear never seen anything remotely like lion, besides cougar, around 5 times lighter. American lion similar social structure African lion which bit stretch, lion probably lots experience combat. safe say lion better experience/battle experience. Anyway, lion advantage combat speed, agility, bite effectiveness, experience/battle experience.
