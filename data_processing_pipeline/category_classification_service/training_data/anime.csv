"Thoughts Mobile Suit Gundam 00 seasons movie Awakening Trailblazer. one pretty good. think anywhere close best installment franchise far, nowhere close worst either, opinion. perfectly middle road compared Gundam installments seen far, that's meant insult. Considering worst series consists near trash like Superior Defender Gundam Force, best original Mobile Suit Gundam debatably first season Mobile Suit Gundam Seed, installments, especially ones go long, straight terrible, series middle road still makes pretty entertaining. series takes place yet another new timeline, called Anno Domini timeline, AD timeline. guessed it, seasons plus movie series anime take place timeline, although light novels manga expand timeline. anyways, like usual, technical stuff improved here, especially animation, art, fight scenes. That's especially case movie. makes sense though movie, mention one came 2010, 15 years ago. getting recent Gundam now, relatively speaking anyways. even two seasons anime somewhat recent comparison older installments, aired 2007-2009. Like best Gundam series, anime themes includes war, also minor themes like love friendship, intertwined anti war themes. times execution themes could get slightly cheesy, enough completely ruin series me. first half show bit slow, although never boring. second half show got super engrossing, towards end show even tragic, lot people would probably expect Gundam anime. think movie unnecessary, still bad.","Gundam","anime"
