"120 days passed, I’ve finally finished first sketchbook, it’s probably valuable possession. Flipping pages like roller coaster emotions own. 120 days drawing everyday almost. first plan share reaching 1 year mark, kinda changed mind realized finally finished first ever sketchbook, sketchbook bought 4 years ago draw quarantine boredom, never did, now. I‘ll share day 61\~120, want keep short don’t want repeat day 30 60 post, probably improve much, ehh. texts ahead quite cheesy personal, I’m sorry advance. reason picked pencil chain events kickstarted art journey. chain jealousy, fear, passion, inspiration, real life experiences, bottled frustration, pushed pick pencil seriously first time. art journey less getting good drawing, fighting fears self improvement. last 120 days, went kind emotions: 1. Fear changes: Tbh, I‘m lazy person, often put bare minimum effort things barely interest in. attending certain class university seeing Pewdiepie’s progress, realized want pull current mediocre life need overhaul mentality work hard. went believing “oh talent.”, “If too!“. started researching get good art, observing people learn art. laid study plan, planning without actions fancy talking, picked pencil first 4 10 years so. 2. Fear consistent: Since wanted improve fats, picked hard method draw everyday. spent half much time fighting much draw, kept feeling afraid “what make it?” “What art me?”. almost gave barely made past first week. decided, really want get good fast learn smart. rewatch other‘s progress, pointing inefficiencies, developed personalized study plan prioritize efficiencyI explain later. improvements started popping day day, fear ”art me” gone, worry consistent. since drawing much fun reminded much used love drawing little, consistent became less challenge like hobby. 3. Fear trusting myself: months even now, I’m still fully trusting draw. happens, normally flip sketchbook, eases nervousness bit, since it’s literally statement somewhat draw. that’s pretty much it, art journey proving it, also escape mind soul. know it’s cheesy, sorry again. . . . Ok, I’ll share full detail study plan, since many asked last two posts, couldn’t give proper answer time, since still refining study plan time. whole study plan prioritizing efficiency optimization, basically constant loop feedbacks adjustments: Draw > Reflect > Take Note > Adjust > Repeat. Pretty much must practices actually help learn. also make mistake, leave is, take note move on, look back actually something remind mistake. make study plan works goal first, current goal characters drawing, main focus anatomy. mainly anatomy study now, don’t want overload information. first didn’t know practice, decided “if wanted learn something, might well learn pros.”, bought books anatomy. one good think book course, it‘s like teacher telling whenever you’re sure do, it’s like everyone exactly next time right? whenever don’t know practice, pretty much everyday :p, open book tells exactly next. Also start, study plan kinda go fast cut corner, realized hurt long run. went cherry picking example draw book, draw almost everything, gave fast part enjoy process. However, study plan / feedback loop, kinda like echo chamber, that’s occasionally try get external feedback pros, like making posts like this. I’m sorry sounds cunning like I’m trying use people personal gain. last least, Balance. Grinding away fundamentals studies get boring pretty quick, whenever I‘m mood lazy, still try show draw something fun like anime stuffs, doesn’t always serious grind, it’s showing consistent. whenever finish study day, there’s time blank space paper left, fill something fun. one probably quite controversial art community, find ChatGPT useful hobby virtual assistant. However don’t use generate image, chatbot get information, feedback, brainstorming. That’s pretty much everything study plan, probably won’t line post, it’s adaptable. . . .
