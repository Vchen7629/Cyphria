Also DCF example know apparently frequently used. complex formular every single variable assumption assume something one percent value changes drastically like someone even predict future cash flows 5+ years dynamics going on. mean don’t even know happens tomorrow beneficial evaluate something based assumptions future scope 5+ years. evaluating DCF someone think: Yo assumed value margin outcome changes much maybe would something completely different. think like almost everything learn especially predictive stuff. useful really much theoretical non sense people say something making decisions?","business","business"
