"Should I do a DBA or keep growing under current name? When I first labeled my business it, was sales centered but eventually I got referrals into other industries.  The word ""sales"" is in my business LLC name but in Spanish.  Now it doesn't make much sense when targeting clients that does not need ""sales"" teams just assistants.  (I am in the BPO industry).  They just want assistants and my MX corporation to deal with all the legal benefits and HR part.   I would like to make a dba and create a more generic name.  For example instead of ""sales outsourcing"" maybe ""VirtualPro"" (for the record i am NOT using this or even thinking about this name, i am just using it as an example"" - .   Our main way of getting clients is personal connections and referals for most part.  So question is- is it worth getting dba if obtaining new clients is via personal reference and get dba later when we do more Automated marketing?","business","business"

First all, I‚Äôm Ukraine I‚Äôve experienced war firsthand. past three years I‚Äôve adapt new conditions learned lessons stay life. valuable lesson I‚Äôve learned: life precious, often shorter imagine. guarantees you‚Äôll time world. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs worth thinking pursue dreams now, someday future. course, depends resources situation. first business hardware startup. team school friends came together create device would help people control climate room improve well-being. Two years mistakes poor decisions eventually led team falling apart startup shutting down. experience business development, market research, things disorganized. despite everything, managed create working version product, national competition, made couple dozen sales. Here‚Äôs another key piece advice: understand product service. market research, interview potential users, build minimum viable product, try clearly define value. can‚Äôt explain business matters one sentence, you‚Äôre probably right track. idea solve real problem. least create compelling one solve (haha). second business video game development studio. working hardware project, also got game development. started learning programming making games. total crap, loved process. shutting first startup, got idea start making commercial mobile games. shared idea friend, 3D artist, began new journey. hard, exciting. Within first six months, released game started earning $1K per month without spending anything ads. us, incredible, thrilled. kept working game war began, eventually sell project put everything hold. didn‚Äôt give up. adapted new reality kept building project project. nothing worked. two years, made games saw profit all. end, decided shut everything down. burned frustrated mobile market. Despite efforts ‚Äì asking advice, talking players, hours brainstorming ‚Äì couldn‚Äôt find niche. felt like gambling business creative field. Lesson learned: don‚Äôt see clear path profit, need rethink business. shouldn‚Äôt expect make good money first 6 12 months, especially without major investments. you‚Äôve working year two zero results, it‚Äôs worth asking whether business worth continuing. didn‚Äôt give games entirely. Instead, completely changed strategy. moved console platforms began offering porting publishing services. Platforms like Nintendo, PlayStation, Xbox high entry threshold, many developers find expensive time-consuming release games there. solve problem exchange percentage sales. start 2024, switched new model, December already reached break-even. five full-time employees, six months, we‚Äôre slowly steadily becoming profitable. won‚Äôt lie ‚Äì difficult path. still days think quitting starting something completely different. Game development isn‚Äôt highest-paying industry tech, it‚Äôs also bad people think. don‚Äôt plan stop business.
