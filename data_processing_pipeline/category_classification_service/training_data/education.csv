I‚Äôm not really interested in understanding‚ÄîI just memorize and write down what I remember in the test, even if I don‚Äôt understand a single word. I only study during exam time, and thank God I manage to get decent grades. I need to raise my GPA by 0.6% to get the scholarship. That sounds like a small number, right? But the problem is, I‚Äôm kind of late. If I had pushed myself a bit in the first semester, I might‚Äôve reached my goal (kind of‚Äîthough I don‚Äôt think I could‚Äôve maintained that GPA). But unfortunately, I slacked off. Now I have two semesters left. I need to get around 98.5% in the next semester to reach my goal, and that‚Äôs a really high target for me, since I‚Äôve never gotten that before. My GPA usually ranges between 90% and 95%. Or, I could get around 96.3% across both remaining semesters. But honestly, I don‚Äôt think I can hit that target. I want to give it my all from the start of the year. and even if i get it i don‚Äôt think so i can maintain that GPA.I want to review daily. I don‚Äôt want to regret it after graduating.
