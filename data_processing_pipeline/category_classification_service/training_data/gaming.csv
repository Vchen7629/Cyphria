"cursed game design MMOs gather common things people complain mmos paradox. Player: want MMO rewards time gives progression also infinite amount content explore. First sentence hear commonly possible achieve, players want put hours game, get new gear, unlock new content, eventually catch end content. Devs cannot create infinite worlds grind pace players play them. Devs either create daily chores slow progress time-gating make game progression extremely slow takes time grind. Player: want MMO put 12 hours day grinding, hardcore PvP player. Also, want MMO big player base competition game gets excellent care devs. another paradox: every competitive MMO heavily relies gear PvP eventually dies out. reason release, healthiest state, everyone starts clean slate, eventually players hardcore outpace less hardcore casuals, reducing community few. makes devs less profits, take less care game, people quit even snowball effect. Even catch-up mechanics, hardcore players keep outgearing others. Player: want MMO enjoy solo pace force socialize. main problem mentality way work exclusively PvE MMO, alienate pvp competitive players, time, heavily demanding devs constantly create new content, much games like FF WoW done good job side, appeal everyone actually wants socialize mmos. Player: want MMO trading auction house, also want bots, RMT, P2W. another conundrum: long sell things players, real money involved. nature humans pay things cannot have. Player: want MMO army friends fighting masses players like big war. Also, want balanced experience forces almost equal. another big problem ZvZ-type games: rarely feel balanced, time players always band potential winning side. usually ends happening one big group players dominating game gatekeeping everyone else. Player: casual player, Dad, put 2 hours game still would like participate active competitive content. another problem mmos today's landscape. Wow Mmos time released, player base teenagers infinite time throw. many players full-time dads. players feel alienated playing competitive PvP mmos cannot play much hardcore players. Player: want MMO horizontal progression players cannot grind infinitely upwards balanced game. sounds excellent paper, happens generally players' motivation grinding bigger power accumulation involved; remove aspect, less players feel need competitive play, therefore enough motivation play game. Player: want RPG elements open world make players enjoy different types content, like big meteor event changes landscape players interact it. another big problem devs: big events involve lot players. Ideally, want everyone access it, players logged time, alienate players enjoying kind mechanic. much want blame devs making great MMO, one hardest game genres pull off, ROI low amount content need create. companies like NCsoft went full gambling p2w cash grab; make money way. saying impossible make good mmo, many cursed problems dev, question really worth try pull off.

"Let's Talk Exploration: Right Why? previous post mine voiced small grievance FFXIV's love invisible walls, got quite couple comments agreeing sentiment open world exploration is... lacking... say least. MMOs done right, all? did, feel ""secret"" creating world worth exploring? feel still missing talk exploration open world MMO games? me, mostly feel best way incentive exploration sense discovery. put BiS equip top random mountain, *something* there, small token aknowledgement efforts, feel makes exploration worth it.","MMORPG","gaming"

"Newcomer, Slightly Disappointed FFXIV pretty small grievance, things considered, trying FFXIV first time really got many freaking invisible walls game has. wanted try another MMO, decided go FFXIV seeing couple gameplay footage. those, one thing caught attention ""big"" towns looked. sense scale point, massive buildings going high sky, looked like nice game exploration. got it, however, noticed much scenario just... well, scenario. Buildings, matter tall outside, rarelly single store. doors come across closed. cliffs, least town, invisible wall preventing jumping lower area. Even vendor's stalls invisible wall front, never go behind counter. knew start game seemless open world. That's fine, deal zones loading screens (even actual in-game map quite bad navigation lol). even inside zones game feels so... restrictive. Like want explore. wants think massive world, also say may see narrow portion it. Kind bummer. still keeping playing form time time, see making main MMO.","MMORPG","gaming"
"Souls-like progression but... MMO? Honest god question. What's stopping devs following souls like progression... MMO. thought well thought out, gassed work. hear out. Super hard bosses gonna struggle defeat, essentially race guilds groups individuals clear. Loot random maybe mats gear dropped 100% every clear. gear make boss easier gives slight edge adds playstyle i.e. speed, skills etc. piece way power creep never thing skill expression penalizing. PVP also decently balanced get go (kinda). fear alienating casuals wanna die 100 times single clear, see would issue since elden ring bloody blew up. maybe previous content becomes trivial progressed far enough, that's case repurpose previous content making new content require older content mats. sure expressed thoughts properly yeah, game see going route present day maybe soulframe. little faith. Peace!","MMORPG","gaming"
