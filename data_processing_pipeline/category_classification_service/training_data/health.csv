Symptoms super severe, least certainly compared now. could definitely go lot detail, already written entire post got deleted accident cant write lol. get basics‚Äî long time pretty moderate controlable symptoms, pretty much textbook moderate pots nothing bad, nothing great either. symptoms got severe past eight nine months, actually passing lot frequently used smaller smaller things triggering responses. kind expected condition progress alarming, especially fact happened gradually really struggling since beginning year past month experiencing symptoms much intense used to, much frequent, can't think way considered normal anymore. one, resting heart rate currently sits around 45 going different factors super shocking, spikes daily 230 BPM. Definitely normal! triggered almost anything, sometimes happens completely own. Accompanied typical symptoms listed much severe weakness, near collapse chest tightness head rush, tinnitus strong wave fatigue much frequently passing out. can't truly describe feeling chest happens almost like somebody's grabbing heart balling fist, something similar need vomit, coming chest. Instead stomach, like somethings trying get out. Obviously that's implying that's description give makes sort sense weird fuck. something experienced maybe five times life recall outside past eight nine months. times called mini heart attack lol. laughed went infrequent. happens every single day, often multiple times day. also probably add prior last months tachycardia usually lasted 30 45 seconds goes anywhere one five minutes . absolutely exhausting entire body fallen asleep places think could fall asleep takes energy happens . said, happen smallest things entirely nowhere..multiple times absolutely nothing happens terrifying. also happens frequently cough, yawn, etc. Even though naturally jumpy person, slight startle dog barking loud noise enough send episodes, pretty much every day. Additionally, strong emotional responses.. shocked reading something stupid news something like boom. Congrats floor heart rate 230 clutching nearest stable surface. fun! incredibly abnormal me, can't identify possible cause could've made things get much worse quick. multiple echocardiograms done heart physically appeared normal. EKG fine too. That's good apparent structural problems, kind take serious anymore starting become problem. never really scared symptoms know live every day killed yet, going to, genuinely starting scare me. messaged cardiologist response got anything concern... kind seemed irritated me. exact response ""The increase heart rate normal response stress, surprise, activity. keeping fluids difficult lately, could consider IV fluids management POTS. manageable removing stimulus sitting down, concerned heart rate spike."" oh, OK. That's cool guess sudden heart rate bike 40 230 BPM nowhere totally normal right ? Nothing concerned ... cool. promise really somebody automatically doubt medical professionals opinions can't think world would possibly normal concerning all. certainly feels concerning, really fucking scared. never experienced shit like before, blue really getting concerned something serious could wrong. mean literally takes everything whole body feels like brain short circuits something. Nothing feels like works anymore, half time passed end falling asleep promptly episodes genuinely exhausted. thankfully, get response mother ended messaging expressing concern situation, still seemed irritated, seemed willing investigate worried. Definitely really condescending though. asked wanted heart rate monitor, year obviously do, ordered, received yet. honestly, main reason bothered fact done minimal research anything surrounding heart really idea what's going on, know EKG echocardiogram there's blatantly obvious physical problem heart known long time. similar testing that's done tilt table, tests done year ago, obviously fine, want seem even consider possibility something else might wrong. Maybe paranoid, feel right can't shake feeling, really scary. even seen appointment since early February, messages communicated text even directly doctor. seem worried whatsoever every response gotten undertone sounds like really believe me. Maybe that's reflection treated doctors, really shitty experiences G.I. issues taken seriously, either way feel great scared nobody wants hear me. feel also probably add that. see way could due deconditioning anything like that. active physically be. someone really hard time accepting need take break overdo chance get, probably good thing better anything guess. elliptical use one two hours every day, pretty pretty much unless physically can't it. manage condition, tried medication. bad reactions them.. expected, pharmacogenetics testing done adds this. consume much liquid/water stomach capacity, still enough majority consume liquid form, take electrolytes every day. done everything advised cardiologist, literally idea happening. entirely sure point even really posting , sure probably forgetting something, quite tired moment, need get there. input advice, etc. would greatly appreciated, really would like get opinions something really right worried really normal could considered normal even though never happened before. really know feel know serious making really is. apologize hard read, honestly main question is; really ever considered normal heart rate spike 45 bpm 230 bpm slight postural changes, getting mildly startled, yawning, coughing nothing all??","AskDocs","health"
