Titanomachy also widely different. Except retelling orphic myth Zagreus Hyginus ""150"", romans basically lumped together Jupiter enemies one single battle: titan gods, giants, Typhon. fighting one battle. Hecatoncheries, rarely Zeus greek myth, always enemies roman myth. Virgil places Briareus prisoner Tartarus, alongside monsters. Ovid Horace mentions Giges Jupiter enemy, Ovid goes even says Giges attempted ""kidnap"" Ceres/Demeter battle and Ovid uses Demeter argument, since knows almost kidnapped male figure, like daughter. Virgil Georgics mentions Tellus/Gaia gave birth ""Coeus, Iapetus Typhon"" fight Jupiter. basically, titan gods, giants, Typhon, mashed together. believe confusion giants titans began, outside context titans olympians exactly same, giants half human/half god/half snake beings, sometimes winged gigantic features. romans apperantly, often placed Iapetus Astreus giants example. Ovid also mentions Atlas ""gigantic size"". greeks different views beings roles, place different points ""timeline"". romans believed Saturn agricultural deity that Kronos never way later merged Saturn, thus, way connected mother Tellus. greece, Gaia allied Zeus Kronos. Rome however, Tellus usually Saturn side, thus, Jupiter comes face Saturn, Tellus produces giants monsters fight Saturn side. Also, Kronos brothers sisters usually group greek myth, titan gods, Saturn others roman myth. Saturn always seen Tellus special child, never said giant monster, Coeus Iapetus, brothers greek mythology, always downgraded either giants something sort roman myths. Basically, romans lumped titans, giants Typhon together mentioned, Saturn still different them.
