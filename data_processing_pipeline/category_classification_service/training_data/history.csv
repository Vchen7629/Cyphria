"roman Titanomachy never knew topic ""romans bad, changed greek myth"" always stupid thing like Medusa Arachne something sort, point discussion. one look closely, actually things find roman mythology, greek, ones discussed more. Ouranos castration Titanomachy. Ouranos castration never mentioned Ovid Hyginus tellings origin world. Ovid mentions world created ""god"" put gods place. skips Saturn cast Tartarus Jupiter. Hyginus mention gods reproducing goes straight Jupiter rule. roman author mention Cicero, says ""according greeks... Saturn castrated Caelum"". romans apperantly never even concept Saturn attacking Caelum. make sense, since Kronos Saturn different deities, Saturn way benevolent Kronos was, altrough Kronos, like gods, neither good evil worshipped places god ""slaves"" since golden age, society, state families, thus, neither slaves opressors festival Kronia. Titanomachy also widely different. Except retelling orphic myth Zagreus Hyginus ""150"", romans basically lumped together Jupiter enemies one single battle: titan gods, giants, Typhon. fighting one battle. Hecatoncheries, rarely Zeus greek myth, always enemies roman myth. Virgil places Briareus prisoner Tartarus, alongside monsters. Ovid Horace mentions Giges Jupiter enemy, Ovid goes even says Giges attempted ""kidnap"" Ceres/Demeter battle and Ovid uses Demeter argument, since knows almost kidnapped male figure, like daughter. Virgil Georgics mentions Tellus/Gaia gave birth ""Coeus, Iapetus Typhon"" fight Jupiter. basically, titan gods, giants, Typhon, mashed together. believe confusion giants titans began, outside context titans olympians exactly same, giants half human/half god/half snake beings, sometimes winged gigantic features. romans apperantly, often placed Iapetus Astreus giants example. Ovid also mentions Atlas ""gigantic size"". greeks different views beings roles, place different points ""timeline"". romans believed Saturn agricultural deity that Kronos never way later merged Saturn, thus, way connected mother Tellus. greece, Gaia allied Zeus Kronos. Rome however, Tellus usually Saturn side, thus, Jupiter comes face Saturn, Tellus produces giants monsters fight Saturn side. Also, Kronos brothers sisters usually group greek myth, titan gods, Saturn others roman myth. Saturn always seen Tellus special child, never said giant monster, Coeus Iapetus, brothers greek mythology, always downgraded either giants something sort roman myths. Basically, romans lumped titans, giants Typhon together mentioned, Saturn still different them. Saturn represented Tellus/Gaia good side, agricultural bounty. children... bad side.","GreekMythology","history"
