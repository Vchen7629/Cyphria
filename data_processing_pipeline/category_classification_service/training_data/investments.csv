Let expose case. young person, Sam, enters workforce decides save retirement 10 years, let money grow power compounding. contributes $7k per year 10 years. He’s 26 $70k IRA. age 66, assuming money doubles every 10 years, $1.12M. scenario, wonders kind IRA would minimize tax liability. Trad IRA: Let’s assume Sam high-paid professional 32% tax bracket.
