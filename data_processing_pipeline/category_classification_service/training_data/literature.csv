"Review — Conclave, Robert Harris Conclave, Robert Harris, sharp fast-paced political thriller set one secretive institutions world: Vatican. dives deep power struggles, hidden agendas, personal crises faith Catholic Church gathers elect new Pope. story centers Cardinal Lomeli, Dean College Cardinals, tasked overseeing conclave following death Pope. cardinals gather, political maneuvering, personal ambitions, hidden secrets come forefront, challenging Lomeli's faith integrity. One novel’s strongest points combines weight religious tradition human emotions, doubt, pride, loyalty, fear. Lomeli's internal conflict adds lot emotional depth, even though setting steeped ritual silence, there's lot going beneath surface. Now, I’ll honest: didn’t liked ending. definitely bold, adimire Harris even daring something like that. me, felt rushed fully thought through. raises alot questions doesn’t take time unpack them. big twist end built emotional theological weight needs. story point strong, final reveal left confusion impact. Personally, felt like something decided late writing process, didn’t fully land me. Interestingly, film adaptation came later handled ending much subtle symbolic ""safer"" way, ironically, got much bigger reaction. movie's version ending could theoretically happen real life though plenty controversy, book’s version would almost certainly trigger full-blown crisis Church. pushes boundaries much further, maybe far believable, even fiction. said, Conclave still gripping read strong pacing fascinating setting. Whether agree wraps up, journey intense, thought-provoking, definitely worth it.","literature","literature"
