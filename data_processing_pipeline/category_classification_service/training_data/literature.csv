"finished Clifton Chronicles — thoughts. feel same? recently wrapped Clifton Chronicles genuinely enjoyed overall journey, see clarity — especially reflecting seven books. first three books absolutely excellent. character arcs Harry, Emma, Giles felt natural, emotionally rich, truly character-driven. struggles, ambition, class divides made compelling storytelling. book four onward, felt series gradually became plot-stretched. business angles Sebastian’s early arc Samantha still good, many storylines started feeling manufactured. example, Samantha’s sudden exit felt unjustified forced. point, Harry central character faded, focus shifting Giles, Emma, especially Sebastian. time reached books six seven, quality dropped me. Priya arc book six beautifully built — abruptly ended without proper emotional follow-up. genuinely frustrated me. last book, overwhelmed much space given Virginia Fenwick — point overshadowed core cast. arc, especially ending, didn’t feel earned. Also, heavy exposition later books took away earlier charm Archer’s smoother storytelling. still read emotional attachment need closure — hindsight, final three books didn’t feel rewarding. Still, don’t regret reading them. Archer’s style, especially early on, readable compelling keep going. understand many Reddit mixed series.

"Similarities Bolano's 2666 Borge's ""An examination work Herbert Quain"" reading Ficciones reminded Bolano's 2666. curious anyone else noticed this. “An examination work Herbert Quain” Borges describes detective novel final paragraph line ""“Everyone thought encounter two chess players accidental” makes reader realise detective hasn’t solved murder correctly. Upon re-reading final chapters reader realises murderer someone else detective missed. disquieting twist typical detective novel. Instead book finishing case solved justice served, reader left realisation killer go unpunished. What’s worse, detective main protagonist story busy congratulating case well solved, completely unaware murderer still large. many ways 2666 resembles detective novel. murders, detectives, clues seem hint solution eventually revealed. Like Borges’ proposed novel, killer killers never bought justice, unlike Borges’ novel reader can’t work either. also moments novel Bolano gives reader information unavailable characters oddly reminiscent Borges’ imagined detective novel. one passage, Bolano describes encounter three friends: *""Norton made frequent rather tasteless references ex-husband lurking threat, ascribed vices defects monster, horribly violent monster one never materialized, monster evocation action, although words Norton managed give substance neither Espinoza Pelletier ever seen, ex existed dreams, Pelletier, sharper Espinoza, understood Norton’s unthinking diatribe, endless list grievances, anything punishment inflicted herself, perhaps shame fallen love cretin married him. Pelletier, course, wrong.""* paragraph like mini version detective novel Borges describes. mystery (Why Norton acting way?), solution offered seemingly “sharp” protagonist (She punishing herself), final line pulls rug us (Pelletier’s solution wrong). though, difference Borges’ detective novel re-read paragraph solution presents itself. *had* Norton kept talking boyfriend. Pelletier sharp unable solve mystery, hope reader have? Sometimes life feel like detective novel.

I’m Greece. here, local book culture is….a bit underdeveloped, let’s say. due many factors: first all, literature isn’t really taught expansively school, does, it’s done somewhat rough way, let’s say, many people grow reading appreciating written word all. Secondly, Greek publishing industry extremely monopolized, controlled cartel handful large publishers. make difficult author publish book become successful recognized. Many smaller publishers exist course, don’t expect exactly make headlines going them. also culture extreme overwork, leaving little real free time people, time spend things reading. Saying that, remains, I’d say popular book genres crime fiction, romance, historical fiction, children’s fiction (which use umbrella term book marketed towards adults specifically), lot times, combination above. various authors become locally famous writing genres, wont mention simply believe they’d pretty unknown outside Greece. genres like science fiction, fantasy horror particularly popular well known public (although internationally popular works like Harry Potter LOTR certainly lot fans).
