One novel‚Äôs strongest points combines weight religious tradition human emotions, doubt, pride, loyalty, fear. Lomeli's internal conflict adds lot emotional depth, even though setting steeped ritual silence, there's lot going beneath surface.

"great sounds literature one favorite things fiction or literature generally sound other speech music written well. bad, clich√©d, lazy descriptions evocations sound really bother *per se*, limited experience, seems norm: actually, suspect lot authors think much sounds fictional worlds all, unless sounds symbolic, narrative, scene-setting function. even then, usually pretty boring: birdsong, gunshots, honking horns, cooing doves, wind eaves, whatever -- language use describe sounds worn use basically tokens *of* sound, rather actual imagined sounds. e.g., ""babbling brook"", phrase doubt really means anything anyone ""bloop bloop"" well-written sounds are, experience, pretty rare -- although *that* rare -- also hard evaluate rationally: really consistent criteria judging ‚Äúgood‚Äù sound writing it‚Äôs vibe, obviously, although generally impression get it, irrespective specific content, attentive listening imaginative reporting. for example, ""the willows"" algernon blackwood repeatedly refers rapids white water ""shouting"", weird verb strikes intuitively appropriate -- fancy, fancy someone listened lot white water. think thomas hardy like single best example give author gets exactly right, every single time: devotes lot care describing sounds, already know acutely sensitive listener, would figured novels. sounds place Hardy's books, writes way authors write music. remember first time read *the return native*, bewitched little freaked passage near beginning ""mummied heath bells"" still one favorite pieces descriptive writing, full stop another example, though maybe bit idiosyncratic, alejo carpentier who musician ethnomusicologist well author. like hardy, sounds almost like background characters, contributing emotions scenes appear. my personal favorite *the kingdom world*, mackandal observes plant ""pods burst midday pop flea cracked nail""\* anyway, enough me. assuming person cares this, examples literary sound done right? \*this possibly perfect simile ever read -- precisely apt actually helped hear sound never really heard bluebonnet seed pods bursting heat -- really sound exactly like that.","literature","literature"
