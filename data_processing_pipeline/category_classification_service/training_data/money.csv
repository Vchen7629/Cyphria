"Lifelong Poor's Notes Budgeting first step budgeting gathering information. Establish net income past year. Include money came bank account/pocket. Now, establish outgoing. Begin looking last year's spending format like budget. Take twelve months bank statements, credit card statements receipts, categorize spending. specific. pay rent includes utilities, there's way split utilities amount, pay utilities separately rent, make sure list utility separately budget well. car, list car payments, car insurance, gas repairs separate categories. need total amount end, also need know much going category. Compare total income total outgoing. there's money left over, go straight budgeting. negative, two options: increase income decrease spending. categories wiggle room. can't make rent go down, example. may possible move somewhere less expensive, likely not. Look every category closely see if anywhere room cut. event room, look ways increase income. always recommend trying cut back first, simpler finding different job pays better, source supplementary income. That's say easy, relatively straightforward. worth looking everything honest yet critical eye. Cutting certain budget item, like 'clothing', may seem like reasonable sacrifice moment, end needing later say new, better paying job, could end badly. Changing car ownership transit car sharing; changing two income household childcare costs single income household lower tax bracket; foregoing vacations, dining entirely discretionary spending medical dental expenses - ideas worth exploring. Now, sit budget. ideal budget balanced budget: much going coming in. may sound reckless, categories 'savings' line items budget, every penny automatically going door. Estimate year's spending using last year's numbers. Make every amount period time monthly, weekly, biweekly, including expenses come twice year. dentist's visit $200 go per year, divide twelve get monthly amount put away it. Round inflation. Spend income zero paper. finally, take budget test drive. may take time, bit trial error, settle budget works well practice theory. Make adjustments. idealistic cuts? finding categories cut further? Maybe quarterly budget, instead annual, would work better you. important thing budget - parents', neighbours' friends' - needs work you, terms monitoring spending, terms record keeping. expert anything, try best answer questions.","budget","money"
