"Non spoiler review: Fountain Youth Good artists copy; great artists steal. fitting movie tomb raiders rip every action-adventure movie game come past 40 years. Fountain Youth new movie Apple TV+ skips nods influences instead straight-up steals scenes overall plot points one would notice. Early on, ""haha, straight Indiana Jones!"" Yet later becomes harder forgive. One scene particular: characters scanning famous paintings find hidden codes. creators must think one ever played Assassin's Creed II (even one biggest games generation), scene nearly shot-for-shot stolen game. fuck say anything? dude, watching another dude, dudes read! Horror action-adventures favorite genres, feel anything, going lenient most. could watch Indiana Jones original trilogy repeat! Tomb Raider trilogy massive part childhood memories, Uncharted GAMES continued teens! Globe-trotting adventures deeply ingrained personality. tell never watch again, bother, cringeworthy way through. feel bad film; entertaining, recognize best genre offer. Crew Views Written James Vanderbilt, give much clue value movie. writing credits downright great: Zodiac Rundown. Yet others downright garbage: Independence Day: Resurgence Murder Mystery. guy talent, never tell going script paycheck. Something piqued interest early film directed Guy Ritchie. Every Guy Ritchie film see makes want go catalog, though probably watch Sherlock Holmes again. style Fountain Youth, making action fight scenes unbelievably well shot camera action choreography working tandem, rather quick cutting different angles together. Least One Actor Cared There’s host characters Fountain Youth, two fact matter. John Krasinski main protagonist. Luke, ""antiquities finder"" (tomb raider), charming funny enough keep eyes screen expository moments, also detracts tension action sequences. constant schemes escape situations get old quite quickly. one point, Luke escapes shootout cranking music quickly throwing sheet air, covering escape. upbeat character, John Krasinski never smiles film. makes wonder character choice miserable set. Natalie Portman plays Charlotte, museum curator trying hold together peaceful yet boring life, Luke's sister. Obviously, dichotomy characters, tension expected. Luke seems give fuck consequences high journey next clue. Charlotte opposite, often coming across downer film. constantly berating characters end, even actions questionable. one particular moment, Charlotte tries point Luke's motives him: ""So really saying need reverence."" right, explains getting sloppily drunk, son sits across her. Hey, family fucked up, do? actor plays role pretty straightforwardly, feel Charlotte written particularly well. Natalie, probably another paycheck rather award winner, kind screen. Charlotte Luke's back forth much heart going get film, flimsily holding fraudulent fuckery together. rest cast background characters disappear audience needs exposition. There's genuinely antagonist, Interpol organization dubbed Protectors, shows fight sequence while. Truly, try keep reviews spoiler-free possible, explain anything else, probably figure plot. take Lara Croft unravel mystery. Unseen Adventure Seen There's much explain title all. One character dying, builds crew find Fountain Youth. Regrettably, happens off-screen, see good crew building bonding. may ask, ""Oh, saving runtime make character piece?"" Oh shit, forgot too! sure sequels planned, elements introduced never fully explained. Look, everything going last like Indiana Jones has. Fuck, even Indiana Jones keep up! Fountain Youth follows adventure formula one clue leading another clue, another; forth. course, adventure boiled this. what’s makes exciting! Sadly, there's much set pieces keeps shit interesting. bigger issues come later. whole movie consists different real sets throughout. explanation, restraint shown towards end movie. crosses full CG fuckfest dialing supernatural elements. Suspension Disbelief film fine line. adventure movies well, Fountain Youth, feels like jumps shark final parts movie. Set Pieces Mis-set Expectations Fountain Youth get things right spectacularly! Younger viewers may know term, things called sets actors use act on, giving audience vibe film. Now, everything done front fucking green screen looking unrealistic, confusion actor portrayed face. Whatever reasoning production, money whores gave movie sense identity. Everything detailed looks amazing; fauna overtaking ancient areas stone woodwork looking aged meticulously. Paralleled great scores individual piece, without doubt movie’s best feature. Even believability there, realism set pieces enough let turn brain off. early sequence, Luke & Charlotte 427 Shelby Cobra police chasing London streets. Featuring witty banter brother & sister, comedy, levity, wrapped action sequence top-notch! set stage rest film, alas, best part. disgrace sets, done extremely well. particular one brought everything movie been, once. Summary Fountain Youth winning awards, mean another film forget about. fan action-adventure genre, decent film one night eating dinner. might lower tier genre, sometimes fun movie great watch! would say dare compare Indiana Jones, Uncharted, even Assassin's Creed, difficult considering scenes straight lifted franchises. characters exactly great, action set pieces movie lives! There's enough entertain throughout runtime completely engulfing audience. sense, could great date movie would probably recommend side conversation fill boring gaps. Unfortunately, wasted potential hardest thing deal with. Decent cast, great director, amazing set pieces, much return. Fountain Youth decent feel-good movie bogged aggressive mediocrity.","movies","movies"

I’m watching Lawrence Arabia blu ray right I’m blown away fantastic looks. notice things watching older movies, 2001 4k various titles like north northwest. know reasons why, know. Films actually shot enhanced film natural close real life look. Movies now, even shot film, enhanced digitally tend look artificial result. say “better” mean looks life like, clear (if makes sense), colors pop way more, etc. Digital movies lose color filters digital enhancements. reason? lenses used play part?

"kinda enjoyed Platform 2 [SPOILERS AHEAD] movie alot people divided. Especially hard-core mystery fans wanted ""literal"" answers platform, working, children are, what's true purpose behind entire contraption. Alot people bemused gravity scene. definitely got people scratching heads. movie becomes immensely digestible discard literal answers, look metaphorically. Especially discard fact platform events even real. conceptual space rather physical one, stage societal ideas (greed, sacrifice, repetition, hope, etc.) play cyclically. imo whole criticism extreme communism far nose (the first movie's themes subtle), still fun watch. Great acting. Great cinematography great soundtrack. characters bottom pit effectively dead. long ass time ago. cyclic, staying behind sending children up, safeguarding well-being hoping make world better place. repeat mistakes, make positive impact, that's cycle life. Everyone trapped inherited system, last hope future generations make change. Overall enjoyable. fun watching it. sort designed get talk it. There's enough movie make seem like platform real contraption designed hold people captive, conceptual really real. art-piece.","movies","movies"

Using things like locks trash lids bullet proof shields. definitely forgotten things feel like directors get away things often. job write scenes, hard spend time researching?

Unsurprisingly, ***How Train Dragon*** live-action stayed top box office, although still rough drop. ***28 Years Later*** achieved solid #2 start, although remains seen legs. However, weekend also defined bad news. That's case Pixar's ***Elio***, flopped weekend posted studio's worst debut 30 years history. Top 10 earned combined $120.6 million weekend. That's 18.6% last year, ***Inside 2*** repeated #1. Staying top spot, Universal/DreamWorks' ***How Train Dragon*** added $36.5 million weekend.

Even good reviews (83% RT), simply failed grab audiences. According Disney, 59% audience male. interesting stat, 39% audience 12 under, skew far younger usual Pixar (last year, ***Inside Out*** 20% 12 under). Okay, bad debut. everything hopeless.

Formula One incredibly popular Europe, popularity also picked steam America thanks Netflix documentary series ***Drive Survive***. Apple much luck theatrical releases far, currently, ***F1*** theatrical project lined (***Highest 2 Lowest*** technically going theaters 2-week limited release, hardly counts). project cost $200 million (not $300 million figure everyone talked months ago) Apple WB pulled extensive marketing campaign. Surely foreign markets strong, America also needs show up. Apple's first hit box office? release Universal/Blumhouse's ***M3GAN 2.0***, sequel 2023 phenomenon.
