"What techno/electronic/whatever songs mess with your brain? (in a good way) So, what songs mess with your ears / brain, but not necessarily in a harsh way... things like Left / Right or spatial awareness, knows when to hit highs and low, and uses the available sound space in either very cool or unique ways... music that you MUST use headphones for, you know? Ya, you know...Music can feel beyond multi-dimensional to me, so some you must feel the same. I know there has to be a ton out there, but I just don't know where to find it or what to call it. I haven't listened to techno or electronic music in FOREVER so the ONLY example I can even give is ""Powerglove - Streets of 2043"" It has lots of L/R play, layering stuff in the right place at the right time, different use of filters,... the bass could hit a little harder, but it's good enough lol... this song is an absolutely journey and it feels as though it's traveling through my ears, into my brain, and passing through in the most unique way possible.
