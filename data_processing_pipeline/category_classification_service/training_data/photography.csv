"found perfect tripod yet? build own! Or: fell love Novoflex Allow tell experience tripods far: **Humble beginnings: Manfrotto 190XPROB 496RC2 ball head** started wildlife photography journey four years ago, purchased Canon 90D Tamron 150-600 G2. dabbled photography before, using Canon 60D, kit zoom plastic-fantastic, nifty fifty, four years ago time get bit serious concerning gear. key piece almost every photographers kit tripod. started old trusty Manfrotto 190XPROB 496RC2 ball head, tripod likely known many, similar popular Manfrotto 055XPROB. job held camera pretty securely, trips bicycle foot realised wanted something lighter, probably without center column. also happy Manfrotto plates wanted try Arca Swiss system. **Cheap wobbly: Rollei CT-5C** got Rollei CT-5C (around € 100 time), cheap, light, carbon tripod neat little feature: legs could swapped little ones achieve super low working height. However, simply weak hold Canon 90D Tamron 150-600 G2 securely. No, mean ballhead came included, okay job. mean tripod: could see wear tear, metal parts spider used hold legs certain angle even one two trips outside. simply fit purpose, intended far lighter setups. quickly sold using trusty old Manfrotto again. also wanted try different heads ballhead interested gimbals fluid heads. **Affordable, big beefy: Innorel RT90C Manfrotto MVH502AH** meant get another tripod, sturdy one time: looked online stumbled across Innorel RT90C. affordable (about € 300 time), incredibly sturdy, large heavy tripod. 40mm top section diameter, center column, bowl leveling base. Somewhat low working height. set. ballhead got okay, quickly swapped Manfrotto MVH502AH fluid head (which use Arca Swiss system, fixed attaching cheap clamp onto plate). meant tripod setup, including head, 75 cm long weighed 4kg. that's heavy simply unwiedly setup transporting bicycle foot. Attaching small LowePro sling bag time really option, time held left hand steering right. proper solution, dangerous times, wanted stability (and still does) well. still beefy tripod. **Big backpack, much stuff** Looking safer solution transport it, got bigger backpack (Tasmanian Tiger Modular Pack 45+). busy trying different pouches attachments due MOLLE/PALS webbing eventually found configuration (Tac Pouch 9 SP either side Extendable Bladder Pouch front carry tripod) allowed somewhat comfortably carry camera, lenses, tripod, food, water, extra jackets, massive first aid kit, huge camouflage net, ground sheet, sitting pads, even hunting sitting bag (similar sleeping bag) cold weather. big tripod led get big backpack, much room. Room filled mostly unnecessary things. setting camp edge fields easily noticeable animals. backpack, including tripod 20kg made comfortable. carrying way much stuff wanted something smaller. **Finding happy modular medium: Novoflex Triopod (C2840) Classic Ball 5 II** decided get smaller backpack (Tasmanian Tiger Modular Combat Pack, 22l) take really needed. Camera, lens, batteries, SD cards, folding thin sleeping pad, binoculars, water bottle, camouflage packs small (Ghosthood makes amazing stuff) and... large heavy tripod. tripod attached side backpack, shifted whole weight distribution immensely, wanted something smaller again. Still stable, beefy anymore. stumbled across company Novoflex decided get Triopod C2840 legs. tripod legs? Yes. tripod consists legs spider, joining legs allowing head attached. Usually, spider legs separated, sometimes one leg taken use monopod. However Novoflex uses completely modular system, meaning offer (amongst things) tripod spiders legs different sizes. joined together, meaning small spider beefy, long legs, rather large spider thinner, shorter legs case medium sized spider medium sized legs. meant could simply carry legs spider attached head separately bag, resulting amazingly easy pack tripod. outside could simply quickly screw legs spider good go. impressed manufacturing quality, also decided get head Novoflex, Classic Ball 5 II Q-Base II. large ball head incredibly easy reliable friction adjustment quick release Arca Swiss clamp. (and still am) happy purchase carried photography, simply worrying tripod. be. **Getting low importance levelling** two year ago, upgraded camera, finally arriving mirrorless age Canon R6 II. Still using Tamron 150-600 G2, noticed AF working should, eventually decided upgrade lens Canon 500mm F4 II. big jump, noticed wildlife photography favourite hobby still taking seriously. lots fun see animals going day. Eventually, noticed lot photos, needed work low ground, least sitting ground, really lie down. Many times thought getting smaller legs (C2820) Novoflex, could get low enough choosing specific spots adjusting legs time. Getting whole setup levelled however easy, meaning almost exclusively stuck CB 5 II use Manfrotto fluid head, would better head time. Using ball head big lens means either lock unlock whole time (which easy CB 5 II, still annoying) friction dialled perfectly (which easy CB 5 II) prevent setup flopping down, potentially damaging camera and/or lens. friction dialled means move setup time, constantly work friction, puts stress bayonett joining lens camera. feel great do. Eventually, decided purchase Novoflex even happier. even experience, decided get even smaller backpack (Tasmanian Tiger Essential Bag L) would still allow carry needed. stuff easily packable wanted venture deeper woods lighter pack. sometimes even leaving pack behind entirely somewhat safe spot walk woods hip bag (Decathlon Solognac X-Access Hip Bag, 7l). **Finally inner peace: Triopod Pro75, C3940, C2820, Magic Balance, TrioBalance Wimberley WH-200 II** May 2025, decided time. researched Novoflex homepage days, determined find perfect combination amongst spiders, legs accessories make. ended largest spider (Triopod Pro75), allows easily fit levelling base (Magic Balance) bowl adapter like Innorel RT90C. convenient stable. Concerning legs ended big legs (C3940) case ever need (also planning use monopod) small two-section legs (C2820) eyeing year now. ones using most, perfect working low ground, either sitting ditch lying down. levelling easy, wanted upgrade fluid head well simply better solution compared ball head. However, fluid heads tipping point center gravity lens, meaning whole setup tip towards front back eventually, least affordable fluid heads large heavy lenses. decided get gimbal head. taking chances, splurged done got Wimberley WH-200 II. Novoflex one point make gimbal head, although double gimbal head called Falcon, simply more, heavier larger need. still pity Novoflex make regular gimbal head though, would absolutely gotten that. ""hip bag trips"" still want tripod sometimes, least small one, backup tripod case decide stay one spot lie down. case, got TrioBalance Mini another Q-Base II. small spider integrated levelling base comes cute little, nevertheless strong sturdy, mini legs. Q-Base II attached directly spider, allowing camera lens tilted 20° enough time, head needed. mini setup easily fits hip bag, weighs less kg comfortably securely holds heavy big prime camera grip. finally found perfect tripod - well perfect parts build tripod could need given situation. confident products easily last next 10-20 years, quite possibly even longer. incredibly high quality. Oh case something goes wrong - post service issues deliver parcel - customer support quick respond, competent friendly. E-mails usually answered withing hours (during week) experience. something ever go wrong, hesitate one bit ask help confident solving problem quickly efficiently. **Conclusion** one tripod hardly ever enough, many need want large sturdy one small light one. going next logical step: tripods entirely modular. Want legs smaller larger without changing anything spider? Want big sturdy spider need long legs, working low ground anyways? Want unscrew legs spider make tripod easier transport? it. Novoflex. know manufacturer offering absolute modularity. look products. made Germany company great interact with. happier.

Simply owning good camera gave advantage. didn’t even need try hard clean, well-lit shot nice bokeh practically screamed quality. Now? gap closed… dramatically. Modern phones like iPhone, Pixel, Samsung Galaxy pushing computational photography wild levels. balance exposure automatically, fake background blur decently well, pull dynamic range would taken post processing achieve long ago. Casual users regularly producing clean, punchy, “professional-looking” shots pointing shooting. that’s kind incredible, also challenge. someone using dedicated camera, I’ve realized bar raised. used make work stand (sharpness, clean exposure, nice color) minimum. photo doesn’t offer something storytelling, mood, emotion, unique composition it’ll probably blend noise.
