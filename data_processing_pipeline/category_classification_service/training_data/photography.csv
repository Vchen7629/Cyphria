"get clean focus bracketing/stacking? trying macro. watched bunch macro bracketing videos, seen two main ways people focus bracketing shots, e.g. insects. continuous shooting, 1 slowing push forward camera subject focus, 2 holding camera is. Clearly want vary distance, 1 seems deliberately trying vary distance, 2 seems letting natural movement hand/environment randomly vary distance? #2 weird, okay. shots, put focus stacking software, invariably get subpar results ghosting, extraneous noise original images, etc. using focus-stack heard people get good results software. GUI, command line, that's fine me. know people clean macro shots, watched live YouTube starting points nowhere bad mine. So, feel like combination technique software. bracket + stack, quality stack out-of-software much cleanup need afterwards?","photography","photography"

Why? get people like help others can. lot photographs need much basic help fine-tuning luminance channels clarity. think amateur photographers disservice spend much time talking improve flat bad photography advanced techniques. think would better offer basic constructive criticism gets people learning see first foremost. critical eye foundation good picture. RGB curve. It’s like going math professor class asking tips write better shaped figure eights, math completely wrong begin with. asking chef advice imported oregano would make English muffin/ketchup/American cheese mini toaster pizzas taste like margherita Rome.
