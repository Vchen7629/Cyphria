"Query Eval Python Polars longtime pandas user. hate typing comes slicing dicing dataframe. Pandas query eval come rescue. hand, pandas suffers performance memory issue many people discussed. Fortunately, Polars comes rescue. really enjoy performance improvements lazy frame makes possible handle large dataset 32G memory PC. However, good things Polars, still miss query eval function pandas, especially comes data exploration. don’t like typing many pl.col chained conditions pl.when otherwise nested conditions. Without much luck existing solutions, implemented version query, eval among things. idea using lark define set grammars parse string expressions polars expression. example, “1 < <= 3” translated pl.col‘a’> 1 & pl.col‘a’<=3, “a.sum.over‘b’” translated pl.col‘a’.sum.over‘b’, “ @A” list, translated pl.col‘a’.isinA, “‘2010-01-01’ <= date < ‘2019-10-01’” translated accordingly date time columns. usage, monkey patch query eval lazyframe dataframe convenience. df.queryquery_stmt return desired subset. also create enhanced with_column function called wc, supports assignment multiple statements like “”” a= expression; b = expression “””. also added polars version np.select np.when “selectcond1,cond2,…,target1,target2,…, default” translates long pl.when.then.otherwise expression, cond1, target1, default simple expressions translated polars expression. also supports arithmetic expressions, polars built-in functions even user defined functions complex arguments. Finally, plotting still prefer pandas, monkey patch pplot polars frame converting pandas use pandas plot. haven’t seen discussion topic anywhere. code git yet, anyone interested curious features, happy provide details.","Python","programming"

"RouteSage - Documentation FastAPI made easy built RouteSage one side project. Motivation behind building package due tiring process manually creating documentation FastAPI routes. So, thought building first vibe-coded project. idea set open source project expanded frameworks well new features also added. Project Does: RouteSage CLI tool uses LLMs automatically generate human-readable documentation FastAPI route definitions. scans FastAPI codebase provides detailed, readable explanations route, helping teams understand API behavior faster. Target Audience: RouteSage intended FastAPI developers want clearer documentation APIs—especially useful teams understanding endpoints quickly crucial. currently CLI-only tool, ideal development internal tooling use. Comparison: Unlike FastAPI’s built-in OpenAPI/Swagger UI docs, focus structural request/response schema, RouteSage provides natural language explanations powered LLMs, giving context descriptions present standard auto-generated docs. useful onboarding, code reviews, improving overall API clarity. suggestions validations welcomed.

"Built CLI tool run commands & transfer files SSH across multiple servers created CLI tool named sshsync, built using Python, helps execute shell commands transfer files multiple servers SSH, concurrently. Project Does: sshsync allows run shell commands transfer files across multiple remote servers efficiently, using SSH. executes everything concurrently, making much faster tasks sequentially. target servers execute commands specific groups. reads existing SSH config file uses YAML manage host groups better organization. Target Audience: tool aimed system administrators, developers, anyone managing multiple servers. useful automation, DevOps workflows, need quickly run commands transfer files across fleet servers. designed simple, fast, efficient, focus minimalism remaining functional. Comparison: tools like pssh provide similar functionality, built sshsync modern, intuitive, Pythonic. Unlike tools, sshsync leverages asynchronous operations asyncssh better concurrency, uses typer modern CLI experience, outputs results clean, rich format using rich library. also supports grouping hosts via YAML config file works existing SSH config, making setup easy intuitive. Features: Execute shell commands hosts specific group Push/pull files to/from remote servers with recursive directory support Uses current SSH aliases ~/.ssh/config Group hosts using YAML ~/.config/sshsync/config.yaml Executes everything concurrently using asyncssh Prints output rich tables, panels, etc Supports --dry-run mode show done Logs locally platform-dependent log paths There’s daemon, config server — simply reads SSH config group YAML files runs tasks trigger them. > ⚠️ Heads-up: use passphrase-protected SSH keys, make sure ssh-agent running keys added using ssh-add, since sshsync uses agent forwarding prompt passphrases.
