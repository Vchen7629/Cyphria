Instead opening heavy software, point folder quickly process images one go. **Target Audience** mainly aimed at: * Developers need quick image preprocessing projects * Photographers designers want resize/compress many images * Anyone prefers lightweight CLI tools instead GUIs It’s production-grade yet, it’s stable enough everyday use easy extend. **Comparison** Compared tools like ImageMagick Pillow scripts: * imgbatch **simpler** (minimal commands, need learn big toolset) * It’s **focused batch tasks** (not general-purpose graphics library) * Written Python, easy tweak add custom functions know little code 👉 Repo: [ Would love feedback, find useful, ⭐ would amazing! thank guys","Python","programming"
"Cythonize Python Code # Context first time messing **Cython** (or really anything related optimizing Python code). usually stick yielding avoiding keeping much memory, bear me. # Context I’m building Python project that’s kind like `zipgrep` / `ugrep`. streams archive(s) file contents (nothing kept memory) searches whatever pattern passed in. # Benchmarks (Results vary depending pattern, hence wide gap) * ✅ **\~15–30x faster** `zipgrep` (expected) * ❌ **\~2–8x slower** `ugrep` (also expected, since it’s C++ much faster) tried: * `cythonize` [`Cython.Build`]( setuptools * Nuitka performance basically identical cases. didn’t see difference all. Maybe compiled Cython/Nuitka incorrectly, even though built successfully? # Question actually worth: * Manually writing `.c` files * Switching right parts `cdef` one cases Python’s overhead always keep behind something like `ugrep`?

Even ship something wake mid night thinking weird scenarios, convincing go back sleep since find workaround like last time. saying this: tried all. tried every possible way avoid JavaScript keep building UIs Python. contributed really popular UI libraries Python, tried inventing one back Tkinter days. finally caved build UI JavaScript, happier person now. feel human.","Python","programming"
"built programming language interpreted Python! Hey! like share project working on: functional programming language built entirely Python. primarily Python developer, wanted understand functional programming concepts better. Instead reading them, decided build FP language scratch. started tiny DSL (domain specific language) specific problem (which turned terrible for!), enjoyed core ideas enough expand full functional language. ## Project NumFu pure functional programming language interpreted Python featuring: - **Arbitrary precision arithmetic** using `mpmath` - floating point issues - **Automatic partial application** function composition - **Built-in testing syntax** readable assertions - **Tail call optimization** efficient recursion - **Clean syntax** four types (Number, Boolean, List, String) Here's taste syntax: ```numfu // Functions automatically partially apply >>> {a, b, c -> + b + c}(_, 5) {a, c -> a+5+c} // Even prints readable syntax! // Composition pipes let add1 = {x -> x + 1}, double = {x -> x * 2} 5 |> (add1 >> double) // 12 // Built-in testing let square = {x -> x * x} square(7) ---> $ == 49 // ✓ passes ``` ## Target Audience **not** production language - 2-5x slower Python due double interpretation. learning tool for: - Teaching functional programming concepts without complex syntax - Sketching mathematical algorithms precision matters speed - Understanding interpreters work ## Comparison NumFu much simpler syntax traditional functional languages like Haskell ML complex type system - four basic types. less powerful much approachable. designed make FP concepts accessible without getting bogged advanced language features. Think functional programming training wheels. ## Implementation Details implementation 3,500 lines Python using: - *Lark* parsing - *Tree-walking interpreter* - straightforward recursive evaluation - *mpmath* arbitrary precision arithmetic ## Try ```bash pip install numfu-lang numfu repl ``` ## Links actually enjoy web design, NumFu (probably overly fancy) landing page + documentation site. 😅 - GitHub: - Website: - Documentation: - PyPI: built learning exercise fun work on. Happy answer questions design choices implementation details! also really appreciate issues pull requests!","Python","programming"

"lilpipe: tiny, typed pipeline engine (not DAG) work, develop data analysis pipelines Python lab teams. Oftentimes, pipelines little lightweight justify full DAG. [lilpipe]( attempt minimum feature set run pipelines without extra/unnecessary infrastructure. # Project * Runs sequential, in-process pipelines (not DAG/orchestrator). * Shares typed, Pydantic PipelineContext across steps (assignment-time validation want it). * Skips work via fingerprint caching (fingerprint\_keys). * Gives simple control signals: ctx.abort\_pass() (retry current pass) ctx.abort\_pipeline() (stop). * Lets compose steps: Step(""name"", children=\[...\]). # Target Audience * Data scientists / lab scientists use notebooks small scripts want shared context across steps. * Anyone maintaining “glue” scripts could use caching simple retry/abort semantics. * Bio-analytical analysis: load plate → calibrate → QC → report (ie. project's origin story). * Data engineers one-box batch jobs (CSV → clean → export) don’t want scheduler metadata DB (a bit stretch, know). # Comparison * Airflow/Dagster/Prefect: Full DAG/orchestrators schedulers, UIs, state, lineage, retries, SLAs/backfills. lilpipe intentionally that. It’s linear, in-process pipelines stack overkill. * scikit-learn Pipeline: ML-specific fit/transform/predict estimators. lilpipe general purpose steps Pydantic context. * lightweight pipeline libraries: exact features use day-to-day basis. lilpipe features haha.
