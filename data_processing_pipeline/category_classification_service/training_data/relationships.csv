TL;DR: neurodivergent partner ADHD possibly autism or something similar communicating poorly, inconveniencing others possibly causing damage items stove etc neglect. Otherwise wonderful supportive. deal feelings resentment? hope post allowed since ADHD mental health issue medical issue! I, 30NB raised girl/woman together one way another partner, 36M, since 17. started dating, switched platonic life partners while. ups downs, partner loving supportive throughout. supported financially years stood difficult times. clear loves lot love platonically. neurodivergent, diagnosed ADHD adults me years ago, one year ago, pretty recent. also suspect might autism spectrum. parts relationship feelings resentment build one reason another. always eventually fade, resurfacing again. partner says values communication, reality difficult communicate comes chores. example, cooks, always lets pot boil goop gets stuck/burned stovetop, often leaves there. roommate asked clean says ""spoons"" mental energy cook also clean after. anyone else wants cook, wipe/scrape burnt goop stove. tried telling might ruin stove, change ways. ADHD kinda explains difficulties, roommate ADHD too, potentially causing damage household appliances. That's far worst individual example, things really annoy me, starting cause resentment. example, often brush try ask something, chore task react negatively requests advice. way acts makes seem like always butting in, reality usually intervene worried something go wrong way things for example: saying ""wait, need sort laundry starting machine, want white shirt ruined"". Now, seems switched walking away interrupt him. says keep working tasks can't continue current task right away, kinda makes sense logically especially since patience limited due ADHD and autistic, maybe literally unable communicate situations?, makes feel like shit want seen nagging partner needs avoided I told this, hard time finding solution even though discussed subject - get feeling might think overreacting. thing is, man child chores. split pretty equally, since currently forced move current house landlords suddenly decided renew lease, taken care almost packing basically shared stuff, household items, etc. actually lot right now. communicated needs comes communicating tasks eg. bother eating, get attention first explain task, etc trying accomodate. often feels like give fuck like stove try ask chore certain way. explained something properly, can't get done, things 80% accuracy/effort. guess ADHD coping strategy, sucks sometimes neglected 20% affects others. roommate also told partner hard communicate chores, me, ofc stove thing bothers too. roommate planning intervention stove thing move new apartment shit can't continue, probably fix negative feelings partner. tried communicating way responds chore-talk hurtful, told feelings resentment. times past 13 years secretly thought breaking up, really make sense partner great supportive many ways, integrated friend group DM runs D&D us go well lol. serious note, need accomodating understanding, know also accomodating flaws for example, ADHD causes chronically 5-10 minutes late, unable change whole life. sometimes feel like stuck him. know can't make another person fundamentally change, especially since issues clearly least partially due neurological disabilities, get negative feelings? make situation better? feel like super ungrateful resentful someone who's rock 10 years want hurt him.","relationship_advice","relationships"

Basically, duration relationship, bf insisted could care less shave legs body hair situation is. never felt like necessary thing think it’s ok people preferences in accepting way partner’s appearance, insisted entirely own. Initially opinion shared unprompted, times I’ve checked give chance say preferred shaved legs, stayed consistent original statements—until now. Now, understand person changing opinion, didn’t feel simple, positive. brought up, first got quiet acted like feeling tortured something said wasn’t ready talk it. ok that, made mistake asking whether thinking related us. couldn’t say didn’t, made feel pretty anxious. tried comforting saying wanted respect boundaries, also explaining sudden shift making little nervous/confused. decided open up. basically started saying he’s annoyed cares certain beauty standards. still didn’t know point about, like huh? mean? started talking found certain things unattractive. started suspect talking me, asked outright, “do find something unattractive?” replied hesitantly saying didn’t like body hair, specifically legs chest. felt really confused taken guard this, pretty uncomfortable. told needed time think saying as calmly could haven’t really talked since conversation. thing is, I’m really upset caring body hair. think I’m upset because: 1. directly contradictory he’s said entire relationship 2. timing feels really weird gives pause 3. He’s done before, sometimes really important things, suddenly feels differently he’s communicated it’s starting make feel like can’t trust I’ll say little timing bothers me. Recently, I’ve lot realizations therapy regarding grew up. Namely, lot emotional neglect enmeshment mom. basically wasn’t given space become person often shamed punished feelings own, also made responsible feelings. Realizing emotional rollercoaster, it’s also helping see things differently advocate wants needs. I’ve feeling motivated shared bf, he’s seemed supportive. However, sudden switch makes least question whether he’s feeling threatened changes I’m making, least surprise truth drop seems. I’ll also say he’s done before, start feel relaxed least little secure relationship, suddenly there’s big truth he’s withholding impacts relationship potentially self esteem. don’t actually think whole body hair thing crazy, way it’s come context relationship feels like it’s part bigger pattern.

"AI Mirror Relationships: Reflected Two Different Truths m31/f36 I’ve reflecting deeply past relationship, using AI—specifically ChatGPT—to challenge thinking. didn’t want validation, wanted clarity. asked hard questions, confronted uncomfortable patterns myself, tried understand may contributed emotional dynamic. also using ChatGPT. way. used go inward, break illusions, seemed use reinforce hers. saw questions shaped confirm already believed. AI became mirror us—but holding differently. used see clearly. used polish narrative. point, realized: AI telling let go. Mine asking honest—with her, myself. contrast broke something me. scared too. first, felt like something movie. danced living room music. gave best massage life. talked taking world together. merged—emotionally, mentally, almost spiritually. closeness came cost. thought building intimacy. truth, dissolving boundaries. didn’t notice red flags: never gave clear commitment. mocked relationship “stereotypes.” never embraced world, friends, past. Every time brought something important me, reframed it, rationalized it, subtly dismissed it. Always polished, always clever. saw deeply reflective, emotionally evolved. wasn’t intimacy—it image. became “one,” wasn’t partner anymore. became part system. fully control me—my emotions, needs, unpredictability—I became threat. adapted. gave in. shrank. avoided conflict, agreed her, made digestible. while, worked. tolerated quiet agreeable. deep down, wasn’t alive anymore. Eventually, pulled away. drama. confrontation. distance. Cold, efficient, strangely familiar—like closing browser tab that’s longer needed. wasn’t stopped loving me. couldn’t handle parts real unscripted. She’s attachment theory would call avoidant. I’m anxious. Classic pattern: wanted more, needed space. chased, withdrew. gave up, thinking maturity. wasn’t. surrender. see clearly. wasn’t much—I real. wasn’t heartless—she scared. losing control. seen. go, staying meant disappearing. AI didn’t help understand her—it also helped let go me. maybe that’s strangest part: Even emotional distance **co-authored machines**—reflecting wanted be. That’s real lesson: **AI won’t save ruin relationship. reflect truth back you—whether you’re ready not.** you’ve ever felt like shrink loved—this reminder: You’re emotional. You’re intense. trying close someone fears closeness. experience reflecting relationship AI? affect you?","relationship_advice","relationships"
