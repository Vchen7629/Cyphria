Dating apps felt like option, even though they’ve mostly led disappointment. feels like people like never want me, ones want people I’m attracted nothing common with. past years, I’ve maybe ten “starts” something, three could called actual relationships. them, never truly loved back. I’m always one lowering standards, giving more, told I’m “too good,” “too much,” “give much.” try stay true — it’s exhausting one seems want that. last two relationships left sad. first long-distance relationship American guy. got close loved band. came live France three months, went Montana... felt real. end, told wasn’t love left. second even harder. situationship someone considered best friend. manipulated months, emotionally toyed me, end wanted sleep me. even cheated front me. completely shattered trust. Since then, I’ve dating apps, trying stay open. recent experience wasn’t even relationship — conversation — it’s one made crack. matched online talked hours. attractive, artistic, emotional — kind guy rarely meet. said things I’ve always wanted hear: crush me, wanted take somewhere special, loved little drawings made, could picture us together. exchanged playlists, comics, voice notes. felt genuine. Somewhere deep down, suspected might love bombing. wanted believe.. planned meet day, stood up. said he’d fainting episode still hospital — intern — messaged late enough already vulnerable told really looking forward seeing him. that, things changed. stopped replying often. tone shifted. claimed still sick, stayed active online, reacting selfies, ignoring actual messages. unmatched me, still didn’t follow back insta, even asked. follower count kept changing. strange. thought probably hitting 5 girls time. Still, stayed patient. gave space. Eventually asked gently still wanted meet. dodged question. told okay wasn’t anymore — wanted honesty. reply? “You know I’m hospital, sleep lot” (I didn’t.)

Since breaking ex, I’ve least 15 dates. conversation, spark want see again. others ghosted me.

Besides, like guys aren’t afraid show feelings, didn’t turn all. days later, actually bought cat plushy this, put car display window. two weeks consistent talking, took date movies. made paper flower bouquet, picked up, lot fun movie. parents town, went back place afterwards, spent night. connection felt great, awkward moments sexual stuff (I virgin), everything felt great slept together comfortably. next day (Sunday) drove home work, everything continued usual. day (Monday) sent good morning message always did, didn’t get back me. waited hours, assuming sleeping, started get worried. called bit later, knowing always awake time, rang times call declined. started getting anxious, texted saw read messages. knew immediately something wrong. began stressing out, time texted back could tell something off. eventually got tell going on, put simply, told felt moving quickly feeling stressed it. told completely understood, asked wanted slow things down, said yes. agreed keep casual. next days, felt like avoiding me. wouldn’t get back hours, barely engaged conversation, ghosted times often wouldn’t respond next day. felt miserable thought really something, seemed like gone. days this, enough told made feel, asked wanted done me. said no, wanted casual now. before. ended calling point told really needed talk, told stuff phone. end smiling laughing, realized nothing changed. that, texting exact same, still felt like didn’t care. point, I’d enough (again) told I’d taking break texting felt ignored. agreed apologized, went week without texting him. finally came back, responses same. Took hours sometimes full day reply, barely engaged. Later day (maybe next day, can’t remember) texted saying done ignored cast aside, wanted done say instead leaving hanging. sent long messages explaining made feel, told confused changed, wasn’t even acting like wanted friends. wanted honest me, wanted nothing fine, lead on. last messages, never responded me. felt heartbroken despite knowing short time, felt like idiot getting attached quickly. week two later messaged let know would dropping hoodie left place, again, response. packed shit bag drove house. left porch, left. driving away, noticed car still cat plushy bought dash, broke sobbing way home. texted let know dropped things off, went home. never replied me, know read message long left left read receipts on. Anyways, don’t know maybe came strong, maybe stressed much cared, seemed blue. put much effort did, more. introduced family first, initiated late night drives, surprised work time, initiated almost sexual acts, seemed like everything switched single day. told wasn’t ready relationship, told fine could keep casual, discussed night cried arms. told pressure could go flow, why? Sorry long. It’s like 8 months I’m obviously, closure would’ve nice. Even though didn’t know long, never felt like anyone, felt special, maybe I’m naive. opinions insight would appreciated. TLDR: Guy seeing involved caring, randomly decided wanted friends ghosting entirely. Edit: adding feel it’s important detail — asked originally wrong, also asked done something, wasn’t feeling anymore, clearly said things. said cared me, hadn’t done anything wrong. said cried bed thinking night mind. also told point people pleaser, part thinks may scared tell truth hurt feelings something, don’t know. Anyways, sorry long 💀 idk anyone even read whole thing","dating","relationships"

Searching names said kids. Daydreaming cute family scenarios. wanna man's babies bad. reason want kids mainly pregnancy. idea something growing inside creeps out, scared complications might might happen pregnancy, pushing kid seems worse burning alive, eating disorder/body dysmorphia scared could possibly look kids. idea raising children man?

"deal intense shyness overthinking dates? I’m almost 29 last year three-year relationship ended. Lately, I’ve feeling need experience love romance again—but hate dating. I’m really shy introverted, friends often tell give vibe like I’m interested, even am. I’ve told life I’m good-looking, I’m highly educated (I 3 degrees), lot interests hobbies. spent life trying “good girl,” never really dated. first relationship started 25. Now, I’m new dating honestly terrified. overthink everything—what say, ask questions without crossing boundaries—and sometimes go blank even disassociate mid-date. I’ve noticed pattern scanning flaws (even tiny ones) someone early on, almost way avoid getting closer continuing. think it’s defense mechanism idea opening someone feels overwhelming. friends tell need change want stop missing potential connections, agree… feel stuck. overcome fear? handle shyness, overthinking, emotional withdrawal dating? tips relatable experiences welcome.","dating","relationships"

"Instant affection, zero intention Lately, I’ve noticed pattern dating apps that’s made bit cautious meeting new people. Usually, someone says want something real, starts calling “baby” “babe” pretty quickly, wants come over—before we’ve even met! first, it’s kind flattering, happens times, feels little scripted. Like, least grab coffee first? casual hangouts, straight invite place. know it’s everyone, honestly, see “baby” “babe” early on, get little triggered. I’m hoping find someone who’s interested actually getting know first. Anyone else notice this? overly cautious?","dating","relationships"
