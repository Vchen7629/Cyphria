"Man met two weeks ago hasnt asked first time— I’m talking people? Context: 26F met guy 28M two weeks ago 2 weeks tomorrow, took really nice date. hit immediately really good intimate conversations naturally. consistently texted everyday good morning, good night, hows day. slept together times without going dates emotional conversations too, explicit “I like you”, “I want you”, “what we?” probably it’s soon. However caring kind me, usually telling glad met him, etc. Also, add, hints wanting see Im one always initiating time place don’t like waste time. e.g. I’ll say I’m thinking you, say Im thinking us xyz, I’ll say seeing you? etc. Ive done legwork execution makes bit insecure even though Ive told explicitly like takes lead dates. don’t understand going on, feel comfortable enough ask it’s great meet, doesnt ask plan makes feel hindsight like maybe intrusive didn’t want bad. Anyways, like lot someone barely know, makes lot effort in-person, soon Im getting know haven’t stopped talking / flirting people. I’m sure timelines even likes even though great time together stop talking people admit talking people bring we? question.","dating_advice","relationships"

"30M struggling respect admire girlfriend 29F learning lifestyle past — incompatibility rigid? ROCD? I’ve seeing girlfriend six months. first, really drawn energy — she’s warm, open, emotionally expressive, genuinely kind-hearted. incredibly accepting past showed level patience nonjudgment deeply respected. wanted build something meaningful together. time, started feel quiet internal tension kept growing. three months in, opened parts past initially lied — drug use, drinking habits, lifestyle lived shortly met. wasn’t experimentation early twenties — part recent life. told she’d stopped since me, couldn’t stop feeling conflicted it. also bothered often spoke drunk high lighthearted, almost glorified way — like telling funny stories blacking cocaine. made seem like weren’t mistakes learned from, part lifestyle still identified with. I’ve also struggled find things genuinely admire terms growth achievement. doesn’t seem driven motivated, doesn’t work hard, doesn’t cook, often late. values “fun” work structure makes sustainable. talk, stories revolve around partying high. don’t think I’ve ever heard talk goal project she’s working toward. often drinks explicit intention getting drunk, she’s blacked times I’m comfortable with. She’s gotten hurt, made poor choices, still tells stories pride amusement. recently went party together, around scene friends—the drugs, partying—it pushed edge emotionally. left feeling like didn’t even like anymore. value discipline, structure, accountability, growth. I’ve worked hard become someone respect — I’m looking partner whose values lifestyle align that. know one perfect including me, don’t expect anyone come without past. I’ve realized it’s past bothers — it’s close still feels present, much still see shaping identity. I’ve found questioning whether truly admire person, whether initially love idea — version presented early on, truths came light. sat it, felt like mentally emotionally carrying mismatch — trying bridge gap values hers, hope long-term partner I’m actually experiencing. believe people change. I’ve also learned me, admiration shared principles foundational. start erode, emotional connection. I’ve started wonder I’m trying force compatibility doesn’t exist. Since then, I’ve struggling internally. I’ve found questioning whether truly admire her, whether I’m clinging hope she’ll eventually become person thought was. I’ve started feeling emotionally disconnected, even bit resentful. also wonder whether I’m rigid idealistic can’t shake discomfort. break don’t feel respect her? TL;DR: I’ve dating someone initially lied past drug use. past and recent choices around drugs partying conflict thought drug use dealbreaker me. I’m torn wanting accepting, feeling like I’m losing respect admiration process. Unsure I’m rigid, honest incompatibility.","ROCD","relationships"
