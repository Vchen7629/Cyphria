So, here's theory: God's actually wanted Adam Eve take fruit understanding bad evil, wanted first place understand life filled commodities good, second place wanted understand crime committed bad, third place wanted count God everything, fact wanted able construct beliefs. fact, episode could symbolise distancing men God (that time think could symbolise distancing children parents growth, children start decide what's good isn't) even distancing men religion. Let explain little better: interpretation, God wants men distance religion build mortality; want men good otherwise going hell, wants good built morality themselves, ability distinguish good bad, rely God everything. know expressed alternative interpretation well, even English native language, know much sense count things bible, even read all, like ask questions happy respond. would like specify intention point general beliefs anything connected religion say wrong, wanted offer new interpretation story. also even Christian, beliefs complicated much clear, guess could call agnostic.","religion","religion"
