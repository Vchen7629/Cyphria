"Anyone Else Still Believe “Old School” Doctrines Haven’t Officially Disavowed? I’ve reflecting lately much cultural climate inside outside Church shifted, especially comes topics used spoken openly prophets apostles, mostly avoided softened tone. still personally hold many “old school” teachings, I’m trying contrarian, haven’t seen clear doctrinal reversals Brethren. Things like: • Believing Lord’s ideal men provide women nurture home, divinely appointed order still applies even world sees outdated sexist. • Believing homosexual behavior sinful contrary God’s plan children even it’s longer socially acceptable say loud many circles. • Believing Book Mormon account literal, including Native Americans Lamanite ancestry even though seen controversial academic even LDS circles today. seems like many Church feel like it’s safe quietly “move on” doctrines Brethren aren’t emphasizing much publicly, personally feel like unless there’s clear prophetic correction, shouldn’t discard things taught strongly past. anyone else feel like this? Like you’re bit dinosaur still believing things used considered mainstream Church seen fringe? reconcile “modern” cultural shifts inside outside Church? I’m trying stir contention—I’m genuinely curious others feel tension handle it.","latterdaysaints","religion"
