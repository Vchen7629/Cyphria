"Two-Monkey Paradox: Theory Human Evolution Thinking **The Two-Monkey Paradox: Theory Human Evolution Thinking** Imagine two monkeys. monkeys trying evolve, go different ways. One monkey focuses improving thinking process. works making smarter, faster, efficient understanding world solving problems. monkey always trying enhance way thinks reason, believing thinks, better able adapt. second monkey, hand, isn’t focused improving thinking directly. Instead, focuses improving process evolution itself. monkey believes evolve ability evolve — figure improve process change — become infinitely better long run. focuses evolving mind methods growth, keep getting smarter, faster, capable without getting stuck fixed way thinking. Now, big question is: **Which monkey would smarter long period time?** first monkey works hard think better, it’s limited framework it’s using. improve thoughts, stays within cycle improvement — improving thinking *in way* it’s always done. second monkey, though, working evolving way evolves. always shifting mindset become adaptable, flexible, capable self-improvement. time, second monkey likely outgrow first, it’s improving within fixed system; it’s changing system improvement itself. **The Human Mindset Today: Monkey We?** Now, think humanity today, ask: **Which monkey mindset living with?** 2025, humans follow first monkey’s path. work hard make thinking better — whether it’s improving knowledge, refining skills, solving problems. time, don’t focus improving improve ourselves. stuck cycle thinking more, working more, striving become smarter within methods we’ve always known. why, many, life feels like repetitive grind — work, retire, maybe enjoy life. enjoyment often seen separate reward, something part work process itself. However, people think like second monkey. individuals focus improving ability improve — think evolve process growth. understand it’s enough simply work hard; must find ways make growth effective adaptable. people constantly seeking new ways learn, grow, change mindset, understanding evolution isn’t result — it’s journey becoming better. **Why Matter?** humanity thought like second monkey, things would much easier. process growth wouldn’t rigid. People wouldn’t trapped constant cycle grinding survive seeking fleeting moments joy. Instead, could build systems growth enjoyment *always* connected, evolution isn’t slow, painful climb, continuous, adaptable process. issue people still stuck first monkey's mindset — focusing make thinking better without questioning they’re improving thinking first place. leads frustration, burnout, feeling trapped endless loop. theory, humans ""nerfed"" — potential limited way we’ve structured growth development. We’re constantly trying catch ever-evolving world, without truly evolving way evolve. second monkey, though, cracked code. mindset continuous, adaptable evolution. It’s thinking ways make growth efficient fluid. mindset could key unlocking humanity’s true potential, everything — work, growth, joy — exist continuous, harmonious flow. **So, Monkey You?** we’ve laid theory, it’s time ask: **Which monkey identify with?** first monkey, stuck cycle thinking trying get better methods? second monkey, always looking ways evolve process evolution? Think next time you’re working problem trying improve yourself. making thinking better way always have, trying evolve way improve yourself? end, choice yours. power move first monkey's mindset second. start thinking *how* you’re thinking evolving thinking get better evolving itself. core theory. challenging conventional ways improve creating new path growth, one focuses evolving process growth itself. humanity embraced second monkey mindset, possibilities would endless.","cogsci","science"

"💥 Possible Nova Outburst Coronae Borealis — Observation Shymkent (June 3, 2025) Hello everyone, would like share remarkable observation might related nova outburst star Coronae Borealis (T CrB), also known “Blaze Star.” event happened evening June 3, 2025, believe witnessed firsthand. ⸻ 🔭 Observation details: • 📍 Location: Shymkent, Kazakhstan • 🗓️ Date: June 3, 2025 • 🕰️ Time: Approximately 21:34 local time • 🌌 Sky conditions: Clear sky, clouds, excellent visibility • 🌙 Moon position: Approximately 228° azimuth (southwest) • ✨ Object position: • Azimuth: 43° (northeast) • Altitude (height horizon): Approximately 33° ⸻ 📝 Description event: observing, noticed bright star that: 1. Suddenly became significantly brighter surrounding stars (as “lit up”). 2. quickly started dim turned yellowish. 3. Within 10–20 seconds, completely disappeared view. 4. object move blink made noise — definitely satellite flare airplane. ⸻ 🧭 Context: nova eruption CrB long anticipated around 2024–2025 rare nova-like event. last known outburst occurred 1946. Today’s date viewing parameters closely match predictions star. ⸻ 📢 Questions community: • anyone else observed event around date time? • confirmations astronomers observatories? • officially report observation somewhere? ⸻ Unfortunately, could take photos videos, event happened suddenly quickly. information advice steps would greatly appreciated. Thank you!","askastronomy","science"

Formation: Icefalls form bedrock becomes steeper and/or valley narrows, increasing longitudinal stresses; ductile deformation “accommodate” entire gradient superficial (brittle) zone cracks, generating crevasses seracs. exactly case Khumbu crossing ledge Western Cwm lower valley.
