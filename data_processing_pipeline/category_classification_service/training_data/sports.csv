Brown, DeVonta Smith, Dallas Goedert, Lane Johnson, Jordan Mailata **Eagles Defensive Impact Players –** Jalen Carter, Quinyon Mitchell, Cooper DeJean, Zack Baun \---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **Quick Recap** Eagles beat Chiefs 20-17, 101 passing yards Jalen Hurts. Eagles' run game moderately effective, many scrambles Hurts. Eagles' defense relentlessly blitzed Mahomes 1st half great success. allowed Mahomes scramble 7 times 60 yards 1st half, bottled 2nd half, allowing one deep bomb TD last minutes,[ play Andy Reid outfoxed Fangio. ]( Eagles’ pass rush also got boost newly-signed edge Za’Darius Smith, flashed 4 tackles, 3 run stuffs half sack 19 snaps, team went without sack Week 1. Meanwhile, Rams also 2–0, fueled mini-resurgence 37-year-old Matthew Stafford. grinded 14–9 home win Houston Week 1 hit gas bad Titans team 33–19 victory Tennessee Week 2. game, Stafford threw 298 yards 2 TDs, Rams erupted 20 unanswered points 2nd half. However, closer look shows L.A.’s offense quite unbalanced. top two receivers, Adams Nacua, carrying heavy load: Week 2 saw 22 Stafford’s 32 targets, Adams posting 6/101/1 Nacua 8/91 plus 45-yard rushing score jet sweep. Outside flashy play, Rams struggled move ball ground much game. Lead RB Kyren Williams handled \~70% snaps averaging 4.0 yards/carry (66 yards 17 totes last week), L.A. started mixing rookie Blake Corum spark. Corum responded 44 yards TD 5 carries Week 2. Defensively, Rams generated 8 sacks two games, tied second-most NFL. Week 1, new linebacker Nate Landman delivered game-saving punch-out forced fumble, Week 2, Byron Young notched 2 sacks strip-fumble, showcasing young talent L.A.’s rebuilt front seven. Notably, Ahkello Witherspoon broke clavicle, may see Emmanuel Forbes outside! Last season, Saquon *eviscerated* Rams 460 rushing yards 8.8 yards pop four 60+ yard TD runs across two meetings, one major reasons Rams brought Poona Ford fortify interior DL. # Rams Offense vs. Eagles Defense Sean McVay’s offense evolved peculiar mix old new 2025. one hand, Rams still feature McVay’s trademark condensed formations, play-action shots, creative use motion. saw prime example fourth-and-1 last week, L.A. dialed jet sweep Puka Nacua went 45 yards house. McVay aggressive getting ball Nacua’s hands space – two games, Nacua 19 catches one carry, accounting huge chunk offense. hand, addition Davante Adams given unit true alpha X-receiver, missing while. We’re seeing traditional dropback concepts leverage Adams’ elite route-running, especially third downs. Rams heavily funneling passing game two playmakers (Adams & Nacua 58% team’s targets far), made bit predictable. field, expect Adams align outside Nacua move around (slot, motion, backfield) create mismatches free releases. Stafford, even 37, still arm talent gunslinger mentality push ball tight windows – logged five “big-time throws” opener, game last season, zero turnover-worthy plays. However, aggressiveness backfire Philly disguises coverages well, Stafford trust guys force throws. Eagles’ pass defense Vic Fangio built slow QBs post-snap split-safety looks pattern-match principles. aim “compress space” Adams Nacua, much like Kelce Chiefs, using variety coverages bracket techniques take away first read. Stafford loves get ball quickly, especially speed outs, quick glance routes middle Nacua, PA boot rollouts, dump flat. Fangio likely safety top Adams plays, LBs, Nickel, Safeties squeezing space Nacua operate, daring Stafford go elsewhere. One key Philly handling McVay’s tempo motion – Rams use quick snap counts & hurry-up prevent defensive substitutions simplify coverages. Communication secondary vital avoid busts (which Eagles had) Rams flood zones run crossers. biggest mismatch paper trenches: Philadelphia’s D-line vs. L.A.’s O-line. Rams’ interior line banged up. Week 1, guards left game times, leading musical chairs: backup Beaux Limmer (who Jalen Carter beat final two plays playoff game) fill LG RG abused pass protection (allowing multiple pressures penalty). Even healthy, interior trio exploited. Jalen Carter’s quick-twitch penetration could wreck Rams’ zone runs flush Stafford pocket regularly. One thing watch: Fangio heavy blitz caller, Eagles dial heat vs. Mahomes, formula could work here, too. # Film Review Matchups: * Expect Eagles deploy brackets Puka Nacua various looks (I'm using ""bracket"" proxy defensive coverage uses two defenders guard one receiver). useful coverage Zeus, modifies assignments based alignment designated receiver. example, Nacua inside 2x2, something Rams often use, Dejean, Baun, Safety side essentially form triangle around him. Buyer beware, Stafford fit ball seemingly nonexistent windows. * critical passing downs, expect safety shade top help whichever corner covering Adams. goal prevent Adams taking game intermediate/deep routes; Fangio concede underneath hitch slant, rally tackle. * Adoree Jackson faces trial fire Adams (and Nacua). Adams specifically master separation using body create advantage catch point. Jackson must play sound technique – gives much cushion opens hips early, get exploited. Rams’ interior O-line vulnerable: Stafford pressured 13 times (41% pressure rate) sacked 3 times Week 1. Rams find obvious passing downs, Fangio might dial occasional interior stunt blitz Campbell Baun exploit communication issues inside. Stafford mobile, collapsing pocket quickest path shutting L.A.’s passing attack. Expect Rams keep funneling passing game Puka Nacua. He’s 11-for-11 in-breaking routes nearly +18 points added seam catches, far away NFL. McVay’s “exit motion” (often TE) designed clear space Nacua middle. Eagles’ LBs safeties need squeeze windows reroute early. L.A. runs mostly under-center, inside-zone scheme. Outside runs typically motion side, keying motion critical edge players. Expect quick rollouts dump-offs right flat, staple early-down script. Fangio likely avoid heavy press Davante Adams prevent giving Stafford easy go-balls back-shoulder shots. would benefit shading safety take away vertical shots. Rams lead NFL play-action attempts (27). Eagles must hold zones overcommit downhill, Stafford rip crossers behind them. \----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # Eagles Offense vs. Rams Defense two weeks, Eagles leaned heavily Saquon Barkley elite OL passing game finds footing. Barkley torched defense last season (460 yards two games), Rams’ post-Donald front remains vulnerable power inside-zone runs. Shula’s defense mixes late rotations simulated pressures rather constant blitzing, may send timely safety run blitzes put Philly behind sticks. risks opening quick slants seams, Hurts reads well. L.A.’s secondary inconsistent, outside CBs don’t match favorably Brown Smith. Brown's physicality problem Rams boundary quick slants, outs, comebacks, double-moves menu. Smith win deep crossers Rams rotate late single-high. obvious passing situations, Rams often deploy Cheetah package (5 DL + 6 DBs), designed create pressure 6 DBs field. successful package last year early season, exploited get ball space playmakers blockers ahead (especially swing passes, tunnel screens, designed QB keepers). # Film Review Matchups: * Eagles able combo-block interior DL create lanes cutbacks Saquon. climb clean second level, Barkley finally generate explosive run. * Expect designer QB runs punish hyper-aggressive pass rush. QB Counter Bash, Zone Read, QB lead likely pay dividends. * Look isolation routes AJ pair mediocre CBs (Witherspoon/Durant). Slants easy buttons Rams play coverage, struggle tackle back end. * Rams often generate pressure twists loops. Eagles OL must crisp exchanges allow Hurts punish downfield. Rams’ edge rushers get upfield quickly, leaving vulnerable QB scrambles counter runs. Eagles would keen run QB counter bash designed keepers Hurts. Jared Verse neutralized well-timed chips often loses balance hit side. * Rams put bunch guys line scrimmage play aggressively outside, know ball comes quickly. fake screen wheel,[ Eagles used last year]( Packers, great chance working week Eagles deploy it. L.A. show loaded fronts mug A-gaps, Eagles must answers (quick game, screens, max-protect shots). * Rams susceptible screens; look RB screen, bubble, tunnel screen punish aggressiveness. # Bottom Line Rams, like Cowboys, pair WRs stress Eagles secondary, especially Adoree Jackson rookie Mukuba. Eagles limit Nacua, especially getting interior pressure Stafford, able limit Rams field goals. Eagles' offense needs open pass game week, Rams vulnerable secondary, likely see significant snaps Emmanuel Forbes Cobie Durant. LBs slow wholly dependent hyper-aggressive front, give OL's headaches. **Rams** \- 20 **Eagles** \- 23","nfl","sports"
