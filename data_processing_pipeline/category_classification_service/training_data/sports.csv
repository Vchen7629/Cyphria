"Managing strike zone batter 2025 (This photo strike 3 call Jazz Chisholm yesterday) Tigers fan, feel like talking teams fans equally. know modern game played. still high 'three true outcome' phase despite smallball baserunning becoming crucial again. Taking walks still critically important. risk ""old man get lawn"" guy...I say...**The umpires still human**! humans gone lasers...if take pitch 1-2 inches plate, might get rung up, might call strike. play fire much? Swing bat. amount *close takes* 2 strike counts see right ridiculous. watch baseball day free time. watch Big Inning. mlb package. would want hitters approach playoffs. Phillies taking pitches millimeters plate Sandy Alcantara yesterday appalled umpire called one strike. know need make pitcher throw strikes, arguing that. arguing letting entire at-bat (and maybe season) come guy like Laz Diaz, insane. fine approach automated robot umpires...but strategy overall style play gonna f\*\*\* someone playoffs find funny. teach players whole lives protect 2 strikes swing close...then get majors games become 'take-a-thon' daring umpire make call. Jazz might right photo, ball. worst call ever seen? No. happened every major leaguer? Yes. TLDR: ballsy 2-strike takes jumped shark, swing bat...if leave fate hands human umpire, deserve bad calls...until robots.","mlb","sports"
