"Review According Jim Today, finished watching entire series, eight full seasons *According Jim*! outstanding sitcom, rated 9/10 IMDb. humor throughout fantastic, Jim Andy often laughing loud. However, would preferred Andy portrayed stronger, assertive character. Instead, often came across timid, oversized child bullied Jim also sisters, Cheryl Dana. would nice see Andy stand often. \- Finale: Surprising End series finale caught guard. mere seconds, Jim choked food found trial afterlife. Although twist comedic potential, resolution felt somewhat underwhelming. Jim returned life decided wouldn‚Äôt change thing himself, fitting conclusion stubborn character, felt like standard episode rather definitive series finale. lacked emotional weight resolution typically expected show‚Äôs conclusion. \- Watching Characters Grow One enjoyable aspects *According Jim* watching characters grow years. Cheryl Jim‚Äôs children, particularly Ruby, wonderful arcs matured. Ruby‚Äôs teenage rebellions especially entertaining, wish show explored episodes focusing adolescence. Watching family dynamic evolve eight seasons heartwarming added depth comedy. \- Comparing Sitcoms *According Jim*, watched *The King Queens*, another excellent sitcom. finishing that, transitioned *According Jim*, watching daily Disney Plus. I‚Äôve completed series, I‚Äôm lookout next comedy binge. Suggestions welcome! \- Episodes Disliked Despite loving series overall, handful episodes found disappointing. Here‚Äôs list, along reasons IMDb ratings: 1. **Season 1, Episode 8: ""The Turkey Bowl""** \- **Rating: 6/10** | episode letdown Jim didn‚Äôt invite Lewis Thanksgiving dinner, despite knowing grieving alone losing wife. shocking character typically warm family dynamic series. expected Jim Cheryl show compassion, made episode feel cold unpleasant. 2. **Season 4, Episode 14: ""A Crying Shame""** \- **Rating: 5/10** | Cheryl discouraged Jim expressing emotions, insisting shouldn‚Äôt cry, even though wished would. Jim crying movie exaggerated comedic effect, Cheryl‚Äôs insistence always stoic cold felt harsh. undermined emotional honesty often found marriage. 3. **Season 6, Episode 13: ""The At-Bat""** \- **Rating: 1/10** | worst episode entire series. hated Jim family mocked Andy‚Äôs weight death. complete lack respect deceased made episode unfunny also deeply uncomfortable watch. inappropriate mean-spirited approach comedy. 4. **Season 7, Episode 4: ""The Perfect Fight""** \- **Rating: 4/10 |** episode, Jim‚Äôs children‚Äôs hatred toward Andy top. pranks weren‚Äôt funny, Jim‚Äôs failure intervene made worse. Jim Andy supposed best friends, Jim nothing defend him. Andy retaliated, Jim‚Äôs anger pie-throwing felt unjustified. episode lacked usual balance humor heart. 5. **Season 8, Episode 1: ""The Blankie""** \- **Rating: 2/10** | Jim Cheryl‚Äôs behavior episode appalling. manipulated children servants falsely blaming losing cherished baby blanket, Jim secretly hidden. make matters worse, Andy unfairly punished forced act kids‚Äô servant, Jim even gave Kyle permission whip Andy belt. disturbing unfunny episode. \- Final Thoughts five episodes left bitter taste made question direction show moments. I‚Äôm sure creators thought storylines good idea. However, remaining episodes consistently hilarious, clever writing excellent performances cast. Overall, *According Jim* remains one favorite sitcoms, despite occasional missteps. show‚Äôs humor, heart, character growth kept hooked eight seasons. you‚Äôre looking light-hearted comedy lovable, albeit flawed, protagonist, series definitely worth watch!","TvShows","tvshows"
